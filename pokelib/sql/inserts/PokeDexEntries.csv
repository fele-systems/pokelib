3711;127;Moon;One solid blow from its horns is enough to split apart a large tree. Its greatest rival in Alola is Vikavolt.
3712;127;Ultra Sun;It gets into territorial disputes with Vikavolt. For some reason, it apparently gets along well with Heracross in Alola.
3713;127;Ultra Moon;Although it’s tough, it can’t handle cold well. When night falls, it buries itself in leafage and sleeps.
3714;127;Let's Go Pikachu,Let's Go Eevee;Grips its prey in its pincers and squeezes hard! It can’t move if it’s cold, so it lives in warm places.

3733;128;Sun;Historically, people in areas all over the world have ridden Tauros, but the practice is said to have started in Alola.
3734;128;Moon;Although it’s known to be a fierce Pokémon, Tauros in the Alola region are said to possess a measure of calmness.
3735;128;Ultra Sun;They live in groups. The one with the longest, thickest, and most-scarred horns is the boss of the herd.
3736;128;Ultra Moon;The climate seems to be related to the reason Tauros in Alola are a little calmer than those in other regions.
3737;128;Let's Go Pikachu,Let's Go Eevee;A rowdy Pokémon with a lot of stamina. Once running, it won’t stop until it hits something.

3745;129;Ruby;MAGIKARP is a pathetic excuse for a POKéMON that is only capable of flopping and splashing. This behavior prompted scientists to undertake research into it.
3746;129;Sapphire;MAGIKARP is virtually useless in battle as it can only splash around. As a result, it is considered to be weak. However, it is actually a very hardy POKéMON that can survive in any body of water no matter how polluted it is.
3747;129;FireRed;It is virtually worthless in terms of both power and speed. It is the most weak and pathetic POKéMON in the world.

3760;129;Sun;Although weak and helpless, this Pokémon is incredibly fertile. They exist in such multitudes, you’ll soon grow tired of seeing them.
3761;129;Moon;Its reckless leaps make it easy pickings for predators. On the bright side, many Pokémon enjoy longer life spans, thanks to Magikarp.
3762;129;Ultra Sun;In the distant past, they were fairly strong, but they have become gradually weaker over time.
3763;129;Ultra Moon;Thanks to their strong hold on life, dirty water doesn’t bother them at all. They live in waters all over the world!

10067;534;Black;It is thought that Conkeldurr taught humans how to make concrete more than 2,000 years ago.
10068;534;White;They use concrete pillars as walking canes. They know moves that enable them to swing the pillars freely in battle.

10204;551;Sun;It submerges itself in sand and moves as if swimming. This wise behavior keeps its enemies from finding it and maintains its temperature.
10205;551;Moon;It conceals itself in the sand and chomps down on the legs of any prey that unwarily walk over it. Its favorite food is Trapinch.
10206;551;Ultra Sun;Alola, where it’s warm all year round, is a comfortable environment for this Pokémon. Sometimes you’ll even see it outside of deserts.
10207;551;Ultra Moon;Sandile’s still not good at hunting, so it mostly eats things that have collapsed in the desert. It’s called “the cleaner of the desert.”
10208;551;Sword;The desert gets cold at night, so when the sun sets, this Pokémon burrows deep into the sand and sleeps until sunrise.
10209;551;Shield;Sandile is small, but its legs and lower body are powerful. Pushing sand aside as it goes, Sandile moves through the desert as if it’s swimming.

10219;552;Sword;Krokorok has specialized eyes that enable it to see in the dark. This ability lets Krokorok hunt in the dead of night without getting lost.
10220;552;Shield;Although this Pokémon has specialized eyes that allow it to see in the dark, Krokorok won’t move much at night—the desert gets cold after sunset.
10221;553;Black;They never allow prey to escape. Their jaws are so powerful, they can crush the body of an automobile.

10228;553;Ultra Sun;When it spots prey, even at a distance of over 30 miles, it swims through the desert as if it were water, then jumps out and chomps them.
10229;553;Ultra Moon;It conceals itself in sandstorms that Flygon whip up and waits patiently for prey to appear.

10294;559;Sword;If it locks eyes with you, watch out! Nothing and no one is safe from the reckless headbutts of this troublesome Pokémon.
10295;559;Shield;It protects itself with its durable skin. It’s thought that this Pokémon will evolve once its skin has completely stretched out.

10339;564;Moon;Reputed to be the ancestor of most turtle Pokémon, it lived in warm seas approximately a hundred million years ago.
10340;564;Ultra Sun;It was restored from an ancient fossil. Tirtouga lived in the sea but came up onto the land to search for prey.
10341;564;Ultra Moon;Its hunting grounds encompassed a broad area, from the land to more than half a mile deep in the ocean.

10352;565;Ultra Moon;Carracosta eats every last bit of the prey it catches, even the shells and bones, to further strengthen its sturdy shell.
10353;565;Sword;Carracosta completely devours its prey—bones, shells, and all. Because of this, Carracosta’s own shell grows thick and sturdy.

10361;566;Moon;To all appearances flightless, it was able to glide down from tall treetops to snag its prey.
10362;566;Ultra Sun;Once thought to be the ancestor of all bird Pokémon, some of the latest research suggests that may not be the case.
10363;566;Ultra Moon;Restored from a fossil, this ancient bird Pokémon has wings but can’t yet fly.

10374;567;Ultra Moon;Said to be an ancestor of bird Pokémon, the muscles it uses to flap its wings are still weak, so it needs a long runway in order to take off.
10375;567;Sword;It needs a running start to take off. If Archeops wants to fly, it first needs to run nearly 25 mph, building speed over a course of about 2.5 miles.
10376;567;Shield;Though capable of flight, Archeops was apparently better at hunting on the ground.
10377;568;Black;Inhaling the gas they belch will make you sleep for a week. They prefer unsanitary places.

10381;568;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Inhaling the gas they belch will make you sleep for a week. They prefer unsanitary places.

10383;568;Moon;It gorges on trash until its stomach is full. Then it belches toxic gas. An unlucky whiff of gas will put a person in the hospital.
10384;568;Ultra Sun;Poisonous gas leaks out of it when it breathes. Muk that catch a whiff of that stench will come drooling.
10385;568;Ultra Moon;If a young Pokémon or child breathes in the toxic gas that Trubbish belches out, it could be a life-threatening situation.
10386;568;Sword;Its favorite places are unsanitary ones. If you leave trash lying around, you could even find one of these Pokémon living in your room.
10387;568;Shield;This Pokémon was born from a bag stuffed with trash. Galarian Weezing relish the fumes belched by Trubbish.
10388;569;Black;It clenches opponents with its left arm and finishes them off with foul-smelling poison gas belched from its mouth.

10394;569;Moon;For a time, their numbers increased explosively in Alola. Since the arrival of Grimer, their population has decreased dramatically.
10395;569;Ultra Sun;It locks opponents in place with its left hand, immobilizing them by entirely dousing their bodies with poisonous liquid.
10396;569;Ultra Moon;Some say the reason Garbodor in Alola are a little stronger than their counterparts elsewhere is the presence of Muk, their natural enemy.
10397;569;Sword;This Pokémon eats trash, which turns into poison inside its body. The main component of the poison depends on what sort of trash was eaten.
10398;569;Shield;The toxic liquid it launches from its right arm is so virulent that it can kill a weakened creature instantly.
10399;570;Black;It changes into the forms of others to surprise them. Apparently, it often transforms into a silent child.
10400;570;White;To protect themselves from danger, they hide their true identities by transforming into people and Pokémon.

10404;570;Ultra Sun;This Pokémon has a cowardly disposition, so when it’s not around friends, it basically always stays transformed as something else.
10405;570;Ultra Moon;If a normally talkative child suddenly stops talking, it may have been replaced by Zorua.
10406;570;Sword;Zorua is a timid Pokémon. This disposition seems to be what led to the development of Zorua’s ability to take on the forms of other creatures.
10407;570;Shield;Zorua sometimes transforms into a person and goes into cities to search for food. When Zorua does this, it usually takes on the form of a child.

10422;572;Ultra Sun;A clean freak that will not allow even the slightest mess, it uses its tail like a mop to thoroughly clean any and all filth.
10423;572;Ultra Moon;When its tail has gotten dirty from self-cleaning or from cleaning its nest, Minccino spends a whole day washing its tail in clean spring water.
10424;572;Sword;The way it brushes away grime with its tail can be helpful when cleaning. But its focus on spotlessness can make cleaning more of a hassle.
10425;572;Shield;They pet each other with their tails as a form of greeting. Of the two, the one whose tail is fluffier is a bit more boastful.
10426;573;Black;Their white fur is coated in a special oil that makes it easy for them to deflect attacks.

10441;574;Shield;Even when nobody seems to be around, Gothita can still be heard making a muted cry. Many believe it’s speaking to something only it can see.
10442;575;Black;They use hypnosis to control people and Pokémon. Tales of Gothorita leading people astray are told in every corner.

10455;576;Shield;A criminal who was shown his fate by a Gothitelle went missing that same day and was never seen again.
10456;577;Black;They drive away attackers by unleashing psychic power. They can use telepathy to talk with others.

10460;577;Y,Alpha Sapphire;They drive away attackers by unleashing psychic power. They can use telepathy to talk with others.
10461;577;Sword;It communicates with others telepathically. Its body is encapsulated in liquid, but if it takes a heavy blow, the liquid will leak out.
10462;577;Shield;Many say that the special liquid covering this Pokémon’s body would allow it to survive in the vacuum of space.
10463;578;Black;Since they have two divided brains, at times they suddenly try to take two different actions at once.

10476;579;Shield;It’s said that drinking the liquid surrounding Reuniclus grants wisdom. Problem is, the liquid is highly toxic to anything besides Reuniclus itself.

10516;584;Ultra Sun;It blasts blizzards from its two mouths. It can create snow anywhere, so it gets a lot of love from skiers and snowboarders.
10517;584;Ultra Moon;Vanilluxe is born when two Vanillish, half-melted by the day’s light, stick to each other and freeze together in the cold return of night.

10538;587;Ultra Moon;As it flies, it scatters electricity around, so bird Pokémon keep their distance. That’s why Emolga can keep all its food to itself.
10539;587;Sword;As Emolga flutters through the air, it crackles with electricity. This Pokémon is cute, but it can cause a lot of trouble.
10540;587;Shield;This Pokémon absolutely loves sweet berries. Sometimes it stuffs its cheeks full of so much food that it can’t fly properly.

10588;594;Sun;It uses its special mucus to close the wounds of injured Pokémon. The reason for this behavior remains unknown.
10589;594;Moon;They float upon the open sea. Many water Pokémon gather in the area around Alomomola.
10590;594;Ultra Sun;Fishermen take them along on long voyages, because if you have an Alomomola with you, there’ll be no need for a doctor or medicine.
10591;594;Ultra Moon;The reason it helps Pokémon in a weakened condition is that any Pokémon coming after them may also attack Alomomola.

10610;597;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It absorbs the iron it finds in the rock while clinging to the ceiling. It shoots spikes when in danger.
10611;597;Sword;It defends itself by launching spikes, but its aim isn’t very good at first. Only after a lot of practice will it improve.
10612;597;Shield;Mossy caves are their preferred dwellings. Enzymes contained in mosses help Ferroseed’s spikes grow big and strong.
10613;598;Black;It fights by swinging around its three spiky feelers. A hit from these steel spikes can reduce a boulder to rubble.
10614;598;White;They attach themselves to cave ceilings, firing steel spikes at targets passing beneath them.
10615;598;Black 2,White 2;By swinging around its three spiky feelers and shooting spikes, it can obliterate an opponent.
10616;598;X,Omega Ruby;By swinging around its three spiky feelers and shooting spikes, it can obliterate an opponent.
10617;598;Y,Alpha Sapphire;They attach themselves to cave ceilings, firing steel spikes at targets passing beneath them.
10618;598;Sword;This Pokémon scrapes its spikes across rocks, and then uses the tips of its feelers to absorb the nutrients it finds within the stone.
10619;598;Shield;Its spikes are harder than steel. This Pokémon crawls across rock walls by stabbing the spikes on its feelers into the stone.
10620;599;Black;The two minigears that mesh together are predetermined. Each will rebound from other minigears without meshing.
10621;599;White;Interlocking two bodies and spinning around generates the energy they need to live.
10622;599;Black 2,White 2;Two bodies comprise a fixed pair. They spin around each other to generate energy.
10623;599;X,Omega Ruby;Interlocking two bodies and spinning around generates the energy they need to live.
10624;599;Y,Alpha Sapphire;The two minigears that mesh together are predetermined. Each will rebound from other minigears without meshing.

10628;600;White;Spinning minigears are rotated at high speed and repeatedly fired away. It is dangerous if the gears don’t return.
10629;600;Black 2,White 2;A minigear and big gear comprise its body. If the minigear it launches at a foe doesn’t return, it will die.
10630;600;X,Omega Ruby;By changing the direction in which it rotates, it communicates its feelings to others. When angry, it rotates faster.
10631;600;Y,Alpha Sapphire;A minigear and big gear comprise its body. If the minigear it launches at a foe doesn’t return, it will die.
10632;600;Sword;When Klang goes all out, the minigear links up perfectly with the outer part of the big gear, and this Pokémon’s rotation speed increases sharply.
10633;600;Shield;Many companies in the Galar region choose Klang as their logo. This Pokémon is considered the symbol of industrial technology.
10634;601;Black;Its red core functions as an energy tank. It fires the charged energy through its spikes into an area.
10635;601;White;The gear with the red core is rotated at high speed for a rapid energy charge.
10636;601;Black 2,White 2;The minigear spins at high speed. Then the energy from the red core charges the minigear to make it ready to fire.
10637;601;X,Omega Ruby;The gear with the red core is rotated at high speed for a rapid energy charge.
10638;601;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Its red core functions as an energy tank. It fires the charged energy through its spikes into an area.
10639;601;Sword;From its spikes, it launches powerful blasts of electricity. Its red core contains an enormous amount of energy.
10640;601;Shield;The three gears that compose this Pokémon spin at high speed. Its new spiked gear isn’t a living creature.
10641;602;Black;While one alone doesn’t have much power, a chain of many Tynamo can be as powerful as lightning.
10642;602;White;These Pokémon move in schools. They have an electricity-generating organ, so they discharge electricity if in danger.
10643;602;Black 2,White 2;One alone can emit only a trickle of electricity, so a group of them gathers to unleash a powerful electric shock.

10660;605;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Rumors of its origin are linked to a UFO crash site in the desert 50 years ago.
10661;605;Ultra Sun;It controls tremendous psychic power. Most reports of alien sightings are actually just people mistaking Elgyem for an alien.
10662;605;Ultra Moon;This Pokémon is shrouded in mystery. It’s said to have appeared from a UFO that fell from the sky about 50 years ago.
10663;605;Sword;If this Pokémon stands near a TV, strange scenery will appear on the screen. That scenery is said to be from its home.
10664;605;Shield;This Pokémon was discovered about 50 years ago. Its highly developed brain enables it to exert its psychic powers.

10678;607;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Litwick shines a light that absorbs the life energy of people and Pokémon, which becomes the fuel that it burns.
10679;607;Sword;The flame on its head keeps its body slightly warm. This Pokémon takes lost children by the hand to guide them to the spirit world.
10680;607;Shield;The younger the life this Pokémon absorbs, the brighter and eerier the flame on its head burns.
10681;608;Black;This ominous Pokémon is feared. Through cities it wanders, searching for the spirits of the fallen.

10686;608;Sword;This Pokémon appears just before someone passes away, so it’s feared as an emissary of death.
10687;608;Shield;It lurks in cities, pretending to be a lamp. Once it finds someone whose death is near, it will trail quietly after them.
10688;609;Black;It absorbs a spirit, which it then burns. By waving the flames on its arms, it puts its foes into a hypnotic trance.
10689;609;White;Being consumed in Chandelure’s flame burns up the spirit, leaving the body behind.

10701;610;Shield;They play with each other by knocking their large tusks together. Their tusks break sometimes, but they grow back so quickly that it isn’t a concern.
10702;611;Black;Since a broken tusk will not grow back, they diligently sharpen their tusks on river rocks after they’ve been fighting.
10703;611;White;Their tusks can shatter rocks. Territory battles between Fraxure can be intensely violent.
10704;611;Black 2,White 2;A broken tusk will not grow back, so it diligently sharpens its tusks on river rocks after the end of a battle.

10716;613;Black;When it is not feeling well, its mucus gets watery and the power of its Ice-type moves decreases.
10717;613;White;Its nose is always running. It sniffs the snot back up because the mucus provides the raw material for its moves.
10718;613;Black 2,White 2;Their snot is a barometer of health. When healthy, their snot is sticky and the power of their ice moves increases.

10741;616;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It evolves when bathed in an electric-like energy along with Karrablast. The reason is still unknown.
10742;616;Sword;When attacked, it tightly shuts the lid of its shell. This reaction fails to protect it from Karrablast, however, because they can still get into the shell.
10743;616;Shield;It has a strange physiology that responds to electricity. When together with Karrablast, Shelmet evolves for some reason.
10744;617;Black;When its body dries out, it weakens. So, to prevent dehydration, it wraps itself in many layers of thin membrane.
10745;617;White;Having removed its heavy shell, it becomes very light and can fight with ninja-like movements.

10748;617;Y,Alpha Sapphire;When its body dries out, it weakens. So, to prevent dehydration, it wraps itself in many layers of thin membrane.
10749;617;Sword;It moves with blinding speed and lobs poison at foes. Featuring Accelgor as a main character is a surefire way to make a movie or comic popular.
10750;617;Shield;Discarding its shell made it nimble. To keep itself from dehydrating, it wraps its body in bands of membrane.
10751;618;Black;Its skin is very hard, so it is unhurt even if stepped on by sumo wrestlers. It smiles when transmitting electricity.
10752;618;White;It conceals itself in the mud of the seashore. Then it waits. When prey touch it, it delivers a jolt of electricity.

10770;619;Ultra Sun;They can often be seen in packs in the morning, slowly moving their bodies through a series of poses.
10771;619;Ultra Moon;They seclude themselves in the mountains and devote themselves to training. The form of their kicks and chops differs from pack to pack.
10772;619;Sword;In one minute, a well-trained Mienfoo can chop with its arms more than 100 times.
10773;619;Shield;Though small, Mienfoo’s temperament is fierce. Any creature that approaches Mienfoo carelessly will be greeted with a flurry of graceful attacks.

10790;621;Sword;Druddigon lives in caves, but it never skips sunbathing—it won’t be able to move if its body gets too cold.
10791;621;Shield;Druddigon are vicious and cunning. They take up residence in nests dug out by other Pokémon, treating the stolen nests as their own lairs.

11043;650;X,Omega Ruby;The quills on its head are usually soft. When it flexes them, the points become so hard and sharp that they can pierce rock.
11044;650;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Such a thick shell of wood covers its head and back that even a direct hit from a truck wouldn’t faze it.
11045;651;X,Omega Ruby;It relies on its sturdy shell to deflect predators’ attacks. It counterattacks with its sharp quills.
11046;651;Y,Alpha Sapphire;They strengthen their lower bodies by running into one another. They are very kind and won’t start fights.
11047;652;X,Omega Ruby;Its Tackle is forceful enough to flip a 50-ton tank. It shields its allies from danger with its own body.
11048;652;Y,Alpha Sapphire;When it takes a defensive posture with its fists guarding its face, it could withstand a bomb blast.
11049;653;X,Omega Ruby;Eating a twig fills it with energy, and its roomy ears give vent to air hotter than 390 degrees Fahrenheit.
11050;653;Y,Alpha Sapphire;As it walks, it munches on a twig in place of a snack. It intimidates opponents by puffing hot air out of its ears.
11051;654;X,Omega Ruby;It has a twig stuck in its tail. With friction from its tail fur, it sets the twig on fire and launches into battle.
11052;654;Y,Alpha Sapphire;When the twig is plucked from its tail, friction sets the twig alight. The flame is used to send signals to its allies.
11053;655;X,Omega Ruby;It gazes into the flame at the tip of its branch to achieve a focused state, which allows it to see into the future.
11054;655;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Using psychic power, it generates a fiery vortex of 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit, incinerating foes swept into this whirl of flame.
11055;656;X,Omega Ruby;It secretes flexible bubbles from its chest and back. The bubbles reduce the damage it would otherwise take when attacked.
11056;656;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It protects its skin by covering its body in delicate bubbles. Beneath its happy-go-lucky air, it keeps a watchful eye on its surroundings.
11057;657;X,Omega Ruby;It can throw bubble-covered pebbles with precise control, hitting empty cans up to a hundred feet away.
11058;657;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Its swiftness is unparalleled. It can scale a tower of more than 2,000 feet in a minute’s time.
11059;658;X,Omega Ruby;It creates throwing stars out of compressed water. When it spins them and throws them at high speed, these stars can split metal in two.
11060;658;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It appears and vanishes with a ninja’s grace. It toys with its enemies using swift movements, while slicing them with throwing stars of sharpest water.

11063;659;X,Omega Ruby;They use their large ears to dig burrows. They will dig the whole night through.
11064;659;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It has ears like shovels. Digging holes strengthens its ears so much that they can sever thick roots effortlessly.
11065;659;Sword;It excels at digging holes. Using its ears, it can dig a nest 33 feet deep in one night.
11066;659;Shield;It’s very sensitive to danger. The sound of Corviknight’s flapping will have Bunnelby digging a hole to hide underground in moments.
11067;660;X,Omega Ruby;With their powerful ears, they can heft boulders of a ton or more with ease. They can be a big help at construction sites.
11068;660;Y,Alpha Sapphire;As powerful as an excavator, its ears can reduce dense bedrock to rubble. When it’s finished digging, it lounges lazily.
11069;660;Sword;With power equal to an excavator, it can dig through dense bedrock. It’s a huge help during tunnel construction.
11070;660;Shield;The fur on its belly retains heat exceptionally well. People used to make heavy winter clothing from fur shed by this Pokémon.
11071;661;X,Omega Ruby;These friendly Pokémon send signals to one another with beautiful chirps and tail-feather movements.
11072;661;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Despite the beauty of its lilting voice, it’s merciless to intruders that enter its territory.
11073;661;Sun;This amiable Pokémon is easy to train. But when battle is joined, it shows its ferocious side.
11074;661;Moon;When it’s excited, its temperature can double, spiking hormone production in its body.
11075;661;Ultra Sun;While it’s an amiable Pokémon, if you touch it unexpectedly, it will heat up its body in an instant, and you’ll be burned.
11076;661;Ultra Moon;Its body is always warm. Trainers who live in cold areas apparently sleep with it in their bed.
11077;661;Sword;Its melodious cries are actually warnings. Fletchling will mercilessly peck at anything that enters its territory.
11078;661;Shield;When this Pokémon gets excited, its body temperature increases sharply. If you touch a Fletchling with bare hands, you might get burned.
11079;662;X,Omega Ruby;From its beak, it expels embers that set the tall grass on fire. Then it pounces on the bewildered prey that pop out of the grass.
11080;662;Y,Alpha Sapphire;The hotter the flame sac on its belly, the faster it can fly, but it takes some time to get the fire going.
11081;662;Sun;From its beak, it fires embers at its prey. Once it has caught them, it grills them at high heat before feasting upon them.
11082;662;Moon;It will not tolerate other Fletchinder entering its territory, which has a radius of several miles.
11083;662;Ultra Sun;It scatters embers in the tall grass. Then bug Pokémon, frightened by the flames, come flying out, and Fletchinder gobbles them up.
11084;662;Ultra Moon;Its speed right after takeoff already puts it in the top speed class of all bird Pokémon.
11085;662;Sword;Fletchinder launches embers into the den of its prey. When the prey comes leaping out, Fletchinder’s sharp talons finish it off.
11086;662;Shield;Fletchinder are exceedingly territorial and aggressive. These Pokémon fight among themselves over feeding grounds.
11087;663;X,Omega Ruby;In the fever of an exciting battle, it showers embers from the gaps between its feathers and takes to the air.
11088;663;Y,Alpha Sapphire;When attacking prey, it can reach speeds of up to 310 mph. It finishes its prey off with a colossal kick.
11089;663;Sun;Its favorite foods are Wingull and Pikipek. It attacks with a powerful kick and grasps them firmly in its talons.
11090;663;Moon;It zooms directly at its prey at flight speeds of close to 310 mph, while fiery embers scatter from gaps in its feathers.
11091;663;Ultra Sun;Its tough wings don’t allow fire to pass through them. A long time ago, firefighters’ outfits were made from Talonflame wings.
11092;663;Ultra Moon;Bird Pokémon make up most of its diet. It approaches at high speeds and smacks them down to the ground with its powerful kick.
11093;663;Sword;Talonflame mainly preys upon other bird Pokémon. To intimidate opponents, it sends embers spewing from gaps between its feathers.
11094;663;Shield;Talonflame dives toward prey at speeds of up to 310 mph and assaults them with powerful kicks, giving the prey no chance to escape.
11095;664;X,Omega Ruby;When under attack from bird Pokémon, it spews a poisonous black powder that causes paralysis on contact.
11096;664;Y,Alpha Sapphire;The powder that covers its body regulates its temperature, so it can live in any region or climate.
11097;665;X,Omega Ruby;It lives hidden within thicket shadows. When predators attack, it quickly bristles the fur covering its body in an effort to threaten them.
11098;665;Y,Alpha Sapphire;The beaks of bird Pokémon can’t begin to scratch its stalwart body. To defend itself, it spews powder.
11099;666;X,Omega Ruby;Vivillon with many different patterns are found all over the world. These patterns are affected by the climate of their habitat.
11100;666;Y,Alpha Sapphire;The patterns on this Pokémon’s wings depend on the climate and topography of its habitat. It scatters colorful scales.
11101;667;X,Omega Ruby;The stronger the opponent it faces, the more heat surges from its mane and the more power flows through its body.
11102;667;Y,Alpha Sapphire;They set off on their own from their pride and live by themselves to become stronger. These hot-blooded Pokémon are quick to fight.
11103;667;Ultra Sun;When they’re young, they live with a pride. Once they’re able to hunt prey on their own, they’re kicked out and have to make their own way.
11104;667;Ultra Moon;This hot-blooded Pokémon is filled with curiosity. When it gets angry or starts fighting, its short mane gets hot.
11105;668;X,Omega Ruby;The male with the largest mane of fire is the leader of the pride.
11106;668;Y,Alpha Sapphire;With fiery breath of more than 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, they viciously threaten any challenger. The females protect the pride’s cubs.
11107;668;Ultra Sun;The males are usually lazy, but when attacked by a strong foe, a male will protect its friends with no regard for its own safety.
11108;668;Ultra Moon;The temperature of its breath is over 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, but Pyroar doesn’t use it on its prey. This Pokémon prefers to eat raw meat.
11109;669;X,Omega Ruby;It draws out and controls the hidden power of flowers. The flower Flabébé holds is most likely part of its body.
11110;669;Y,Alpha Sapphire;When it finds a flower it likes, it dwells on that flower its whole life long. It floats in the wind’s embrace with an untroubled heart.
11111;669;Ultra Sun;It’s not safe without the power of a flower, but it will keep traveling around until it finds one with the color and shape it wants.
11112;669;Ultra Moon;Flabébé wears a crown made from pollen it’s collected from its flower. The crown has hidden healing properties.
11113;670;X,Omega Ruby;It flutters around fields of flowers and cares for flowers that are starting to wilt. It draws out the hidden power of flowers to battle.
11114;670;Y,Alpha Sapphire;When the flowers of a well-tended flower bed bloom, it appears and celebrates with an elegant dance.
11115;670;Ultra Sun;It raises flowers and uses them as weapons. The more gorgeous the blossom, the more power it contains.
11116;670;Ultra Moon;It gives its own power to flowers, pouring its heart into caring for them. Floette never forgives anyone who messes up a flower bed.
11117;671;X,Omega Ruby;It claims exquisite flower gardens as its territory, and it obtains power from basking in the energy emitted by flowering plants.
11118;671;Y,Alpha Sapphire;In times long past, governors of castles would invite Florges to create flower gardens to embellish the castle domains.
11119;671;Ultra Sun;It controls the flowers it grows. The petal blizzards that Florges triggers are overwhelming in their beauty and power.
11120;671;Ultra Moon;Its life can span several hundred years. It’s said to devote its entire life to protecting gardens.
11121;672;X,Omega Ruby;Thought to be one of the first Pokémon to live in harmony with humans, it has a placid disposition.
11122;672;Y,Alpha Sapphire;If it has sunshine and water, it doesn’t need to eat, because it can generate energy from the leaves on its back.
11123;673;X,Omega Ruby;It can tell how its Trainer is feeling by subtle shifts in the grip on its horns. This empathic sense lets them run as if one being.
11124;673;Y,Alpha Sapphire;They inhabit mountainous regions. The leader of the herd is decided by a battle of clashing horns.
11125;674;X,Omega Ruby;It does its best to be taken seriously by its enemies, but its glare is not sufficiently intimidating. Chewing on a leaf is its trademark.
11126;674;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It does its level best to glare and pull a scary face, but it can’t help grinning if anyone pats its head.
11127;674;Sun;It grows up imitating the behavior of Pangoro, which it looks up to as a leader.
11128;674;Moon;There’s no point to the leaf in its mouth, aside from an effort to look cool. It’s mischievous, so it’s not well suited to inexperienced Trainers.
11129;674;Ultra Sun;It follows Pangoro around like a henchman. When Pancham makes a big mistake, its leaf gets taken away.
11130;674;Ultra Moon;It’s desperate to intimidate its opponents. Be nice and pretend to be scared if you catch it glaring at you intensely.
11131;674;Sword;It chooses a Pangoro as its master and then imitates its master’s actions. This is how it learns to battle and hunt for prey.
11132;674;Shield;Wanting to make sure it’s taken seriously, Pancham’s always giving others a glare. But if it’s not focusing, it ends up smiling.
11133;675;X,Omega Ruby;Although it possesses a violent temperament, it won’t put up with bullying. It uses the leaf in its mouth to sense the movements of its enemies.
11134;675;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It charges ahead and bashes its opponents like a berserker, uncaring about any hits it might take. Its arms are mighty enough to snap a telephone pole.
11135;675;Sun;It boasts superb physical strength. Those who wish to become Pangoro’s Trainer have no choice but to converse with their fists.
11136;675;Moon;From the slight twitches of its bamboo leaf, it deduces its opponent’s movements. It’s eager to tussle but kindhearted toward its companions.
11137;675;Ultra Sun;This rowdy Pokémon boasts great physical strength. Many Trainers are also smitten by its lively character.
11138;675;Ultra Moon;Pangoro is the type to talk with its fists. It doesn’t say much as it pummels opponents with enough force to send a dump truck flying.
11139;675;Sword;This Pokémon is quick to anger, and it has no problem using its prodigious strength to get its way. It lives for duels against Obstagoon.
11140;675;Shield;Using its leaf, Pangoro can predict the moves of its opponents. It strikes with punches that can turn a dump truck into scrap with just one hit.
11141;676;X,Omega Ruby;Trimming its fluffy fur not only makes it more elegant but also increases the swiftness of its movements.
11142;676;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Historically, in the Kalos region, these Pokémon were the designated guardians of the king.
11143;676;Ultra Sun;There was an era when aristocrats would compete to see who could trim their Furfrou’s fur into the most exquisite style.
11144;676;Ultra Moon;Left alone, its fur will grow longer and longer, but it will only allow someone it trusts to cut it.
11145;677;X,Omega Ruby;The organ that emits its intense psychic power is sheltered by its ears to keep power from leaking out.
11146;677;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It has enough psychic energy to blast everything within 300 feet of itself, but it has no control over its power.
11147;677;Sword;Though Espurr’s expression never changes, behind that blank stare is an intense struggle to contain its devastating psychic power.
11148;677;Shield;There’s enough psychic power in Espurr to send a wrestler flying, but because this power can’t be controlled, Espurr finds it troublesome.
11149;678;X,Omega Ruby;When in danger, it raises its ears and releases enough psychic power to grind a 10-ton truck into dust.
11150;678;Y,Alpha Sapphire;The eyeball patterns on the interior of its ears emit psychic energy. It keeps the patterns tightly covered because that power is too immense.
11151;678;X,Omega Ruby;When in danger, it raises its ears and releases enough psychic power to grind a 10-ton truck into dust.
11152;678;Y,Alpha Sapphire;The eyeball patterns on the interior of its ears emit psychic energy. It keeps the patterns tightly covered because that power is too immense.
11153;679;X,Omega Ruby;Apparently this Pokémon is born when a departed spirit inhabits a sword. It attaches itself to people and drinks their life force.
11154;679;Y,Alpha Sapphire;If anyone dares to grab its hilt, it wraps a blue cloth around that person’s arm and drains that person’s life energy completely.
11155;679;Sword;Honedge’s soul once belonged to a person who was killed a long time ago by the sword that makes up Honedge’s body.
11156;679;Shield;The blue eye on the sword’s handguard is the true body of Honedge. With its old cloth, it drains people’s lives away.
11157;680;X,Omega Ruby;When Honedge evolves, it divides into two swords, which cooperate via telepathy to coordinate attacks and slash their enemies to ribbons.
11158;680;Y,Alpha Sapphire;The complex attack patterns of its two swords are unstoppable, even for an opponent greatly accomplished at swordplay.
11159;680;Sword;Honedge evolves into twins. The two blades rub together to emit a metallic sound that unnerves opponents.
11160;680;Shield;The two swords employ a strategy of rapidly alternating between offense and defense to bring down their prey.
11161;681;X,Omega Ruby;Generations of kings were attended by these Pokémon, which used their spectral power to manipulate and control people and Pokémon.
11162;681;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Apparently, it can detect the innate qualities of leadership. According to legend, whoever it recognizes is destined to become king.
11163;681;X,Omega Ruby;Generations of kings were attended by these Pokémon, which used their spectral power to manipulate and control people and Pokémon.
11164;681;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Apparently, it can detect the innate qualities of leadership. According to legend, whoever it recognizes is destined to become king.
11165;682;X,Omega Ruby;It emits a scent that enraptures those who smell it. This fragrance changes depending on what it has eaten.
11166;682;Y,Alpha Sapphire;In the past, rather than using perfume, royal ladies carried a Spritzee that would waft a fragrance they liked.
11167;682;Sword;A scent pouch within this Pokémon’s body allows it to create various scents. A change in its diet will alter the fragrance it produces.
11168;682;Shield;The scent its body gives off enraptures those who smell it. Noble ladies had no shortage of love for Spritzee.
11169;683;X,Omega Ruby;It devises various scents, pleasant and unpleasant, and emits scents that its enemies dislike in order to gain an edge in battle.
11170;683;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Its scent is so overpowering that, unless a Trainer happens to really enjoy the smell, he or she will have a hard time walking alongside it.
11171;683;Sword;The scent that constantly emits from its fur is so powerful that this Pokémon’s companions will eventually lose their sense of smell.
11172;683;Shield;The scents Aromatisse can produce range from sweet smells that bolster allies to foul smells that sap an opponent’s will to fight.
11173;684;X,Omega Ruby;To entangle its opponents in battle, it extrudes white threads as sweet and sticky as cotton candy.
11174;684;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Because it eats nothing but sweets, its fur is as sticky sweet as cotton candy.
11175;684;Sword;It eats its own weight in sugar every day. If it doesn’t get enough sugar, it becomes incredibly grumpy.
11176;684;Shield;The sweet smell of cotton candy perfumes Swirlix’s fluffy fur. This Pokémon spits out sticky string to tangle up its enemies.
11177;685;X,Omega Ruby;It can distinguish the faintest of scents. It puts its sensitive sense of smell to use by helping pastry chefs in their work.
11178;685;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Its sense of smell is 100 million times better than a human’s, so even the faintest scent tells it about everything in the area. It’s like it can see with its nose!
11179;685;Sword;By taking in a person’s scent, it can sniff out their mental and physical condition. It’s hoped that this skill will have many medical applications.
11180;685;Shield;Slurpuff’s fur contains a lot of air, making it soft to the touch and lighter than it looks.
11181;686;X,Omega Ruby;Opponents who stare at the flashing of the light-emitting spots on its body become dazed and lose their will to fight.
11182;686;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It flashes the light-emitting spots on its body, which drains its opponent’s will to fight. It takes the opportunity to scuttle away and hide.
11183;686;Ultra Sun;It draws prey near with its blinking lights and then wraps them up in its long tentacles and holds them in place.
11184;686;Ultra Moon;When exchanging information with others of its kind, it flashes the light-emitting spots on its body in a complex rhythm.
11185;686;Sword;It spins while making its luminescent spots flash. These spots allow it to communicate with others by using different patterns of light.
11186;686;Shield;By exposing foes to the blinking of its luminescent spots, Inkay demoralizes them, and then it seizes the chance to flee.
11187;687;X,Omega Ruby;It wields the most compelling hypnotic powers of any Pokémon, and it forces others to do whatever it wants.
11188;687;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It lures its prey close with hypnotic motions, then wraps its tentacles around it before finishing it off with digestive fluids.
11189;687;Ultra Sun;When it comes to strong hypnosis, there’s an endless number of people who utilize Malamar for their nefarious deeds.
11190;687;Ultra Moon;It flashes the pattern on its torso to control its prey and draw them in. The edges of its fins are supremely sharp.
11191;687;Sword;Gazing at its luminescent spots will quickly induce a hypnotic state, putting the observer under Malamar’s control.
11192;687;Shield;It’s said that Malamar’s hypnotic powers played a role in certain history-changing events.
11193;688;X,Omega Ruby;Two Binacle live together on one rock. When they fight, one of them will move to a different rock.
11194;688;Y,Alpha Sapphire;They stretch and then contract, yanking their rocks along with them in bold hops. They eat seaweed that washes up on the shoreline.
11195;688;Sword;After two Binacle find a suitably sized rock, they adhere themselves to it and live together. They cooperate to gather food during high tide.
11196;688;Shield;If the two don’t work well together, both their offense and defense fall apart. Without good teamwork, they won’t survive.
11197;689;X,Omega Ruby;When they evolve, two Binacle multiply into seven. They fight with the power of seven Binacle.
11198;689;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Barbaracle’s legs and hands have minds of their own, and they will move independently. But they usually follow the head’s orders.
11199;689;Sword;Seven Binacle come together to form one Barbaracle. The Binacle that serves as the head gives orders to those serving as the limbs.
11200;689;Shield;Having an eye on each palm allows it to keep watch in all directions. In a pinch, its limbs start to act on their own to ensure the enemy’s defeat.
11201;690;X,Omega Ruby;Camouflaged as rotten kelp, they spray liquid poison on prey that approaches unawares and then finish it off.
11202;690;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It looks just like rotten kelp. It hides from foes while storing up power for its evolution.
11203;690;Ultra Sun;It vanishes into seaweed and remains perfectly still to avoid attacks from large Pokémon. Rotten seaweed is its main food source.
11204;690;Ultra Moon;It’s not good at swimming, so it clings to the seaweed. In the Alola region, it’s often found near Dhelmise.
11205;690;Sword;It drifts in the ocean, blending in with floating seaweed. When other Pokémon come to feast on the seaweed, Skrelp feasts on them instead.
11206;690;Shield;Skrelp looks like a piece of rotten seaweed, so it can blend in with seaweed drifting on the ocean and avoid being detected by enemies.
11207;691;X,Omega Ruby;Their poison is strong enough to eat through the hull of a tanker, and they spit it indiscriminately at anything that enters their territory.
11208;691;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Tales are told of ships that wander into seas where Dragalge live, never to return.
11209;691;Ultra Sun;This vicious Pokémon sprays a poisonous liquid on opponents that come near. For whatever reason, it gets along really well with Dhelmise.
11210;691;Ultra Moon;It blends in with seaweed to ambush its prey and then takes them down with a poisonous liquid strong enough to melt metal.
11211;691;Sword;Dragalge uses a poisonous liquid capable of corroding metal to send tankers that enter its territory to the bottom of the sea.
11212;691;Shield;Dragalge generates dragon energy by sticking the plume on its head out above the ocean’s surface and bathing it in sunlight.
11213;692;X,Omega Ruby;They knock down flying prey by firing compressed water from their massive claws like shooting a pistol.
11214;692;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Through controlled explosions of internal gas, it can expel water like a pistol shot. At close distances, it can shatter rock.
11215;692;Ultra Sun;Its claws occasionally fall off, and it keeps a low profile until they grow back. The meat of its claws is so delicious!
11216;692;Ultra Moon;It moves around by jetting water from its right pincer. It has a poor sense of balance, so it’s terrible at swimming straight.
11217;692;Sword;Clauncher’s claws can fall off during battle, but they’ll regenerate. The meat inside the claws is popular as a delicacy in Galar.
11218;692;Shield;By detonating gas that accumulates in its right claw, this Pokémon launches water like a bullet. This is how Clauncher defeats its enemies.
11219;693;X,Omega Ruby;Their enormous claws launch cannonballs of water powerful enough to pierce tanker hulls.
11220;693;Y,Alpha Sapphire;By expelling water from the nozzle in the back of its claw, it can move at a speed of 60 knots.
11221;693;Ultra Sun;It compresses the water it has sucked up and then projects it with enough power to punch a hole right through a thick sheet of iron.
11222;693;Ultra Moon;Its right arm is packed with meat. When its pincer falls off, it’s exported to be used as a cooking ingredient.
11223;693;Sword;After using the feelers on its oversized claw to detect the location of prey, Clawitzer launches a cannonball of water at its target.
11224;693;Shield;Clawitzer’s right arm is a cannon that launches projectiles made of seawater. Shots from a Clawitzer’s cannon arm can sink a tanker.
11225;694;X,Omega Ruby;They make their home in deserts. They can generate their energy from basking in the sun, so eating food is not a requirement.
11226;694;Y,Alpha Sapphire;The frills on either side of its head have cells that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight.
11227;694;Sword;When spread, the frills on its head act like solar panels, generating the power behind this Pokémon’s electric moves.
11228;694;Shield;The sun powers this Pokémon’s electricity generation. Interruption of that process stresses Helioptile to the point of weakness.
11229;695;X,Omega Ruby;They flare their frills and generate energy. A single Heliolisk can generate sufficient electricity to power a skyscraper.
11230;695;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It stimulates its muscles with electricity, boosting the strength in its legs and enabling it to run 100 yards in five seconds.
11231;695;Sword;A now-vanished desert culture treasured these Pokémon. Appropriately, when Heliolisk came to the Galar region, treasure came with them.
11232;695;Shield;One Heliolisk basking in the sun with its frill outspread is all it would take to produce enough electricity to power a city.
11233;696;X,Omega Ruby;This Pokémon was restored from a fossil. If something happens that it doesn’t like, it throws a tantrum and runs wild.
11234;696;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Its immense jaws have enough destructive force that it can chew up an automobile. It lived 100 million years ago.
11235;696;Ultra Sun;Its large jaw has incredible destructive power. Some theories suggest that its restored form is different from its form of long ago.
11236;696;Ultra Moon;Tyrunt is spoiled and selfish. It may just be trying to frolic, but sometimes the ones it’s trying to frolic with are gravely injured.
11237;696;Sword;This is an ancient Pokémon, revived in modern times. It has a violent disposition, and it’ll tear apart anything it gets between its hefty jaws.
11238;696;Shield;This Pokémon is selfish and likes to be pampered. It can also inflict grievous wounds on its Trainer just by playing around.
11239;697;X,Omega Ruby;Thanks to its gargantuan jaws, which could shred thick metal plates as if they were paper, it was invincible in the ancient world it once inhabited.
11240;697;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Nothing could stop this Pokémon 100 million years ago, so it behaved like a king.
11241;697;Ultra Sun;Complete restoration is impossible, allowing room for theories that its entire body was once covered in a feather-like coat.
11242;697;Ultra Moon;The king of the ancient world, it can easily crunch a car with the devastating strength of its enormous jaws.
11243;697;Sword;This Pokémon is from about 100,000,000 years ago. It has the presence of a king, vicious but magnificent.
11244;697;Shield;A single bite of Tyrantrum’s massive jaws will demolish a car. This Pokémon was the king of the ancient world.
11245;698;X,Omega Ruby;This ancient Pokémon was restored from part of its body that had been frozen in ice for over 100 million years.
11246;698;Y,Alpha Sapphire;This calm Pokémon lived in a cold land where there were no violent predators like Tyrantrum.
11247;698;Ultra Sun;It lived in cold areas in ancient times. It’s said that when Amaura whinnies, auroras appear in the night sky.
11248;698;Ultra Moon;Amaura was restored successfully, but it’s not expected to live long because of the heat of the current environment.
11249;698;Sword;This Pokémon was successfully restored from a fossil. In the past, it lived with others of its kind in cold lands where there were fewer predators.
11250;698;Shield;Amaura is an ancient Pokémon that has gone extinct. Specimens of this species can sometimes be found frozen in ice.
11251;699;X,Omega Ruby;The diamond-shaped crystals on its body expel air as cold as -240 degrees Fahrenheit, surrounding its enemies and encasing them in ice.
11252;699;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Using its diamond-shaped crystals, it can instantly create a wall of ice to block an opponent’s attack.
11253;699;Ultra Sun;An Aurorus was found frozen solid within a glacier, just as it appeared long ago, which became quite a big event in the news.
11254;699;Ultra Moon;This usually quiet and kindly Pokémon has a surface temperature of around –240 degrees Fahrenheit.
11255;699;Sword;Aurorus was restored from a fossil. It’s said that when this Pokémon howls, auroras appear in the night sky.
11256;699;Shield;When gripped by rage, Aurorus will emanate freezing air, covering everything around it in ice.
11257;700;X,Omega Ruby;It sends a soothing aura from its ribbonlike feelers to calm fights.
11258;700;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It wraps its ribbonlike feelers around the arm of its beloved Trainer and walks with him or her.
11259;700;Sun;Its ribbonlike feelers give off an aura that weakens hostility in its prey, causing them to let down their guard. Then it attacks.
11260;700;Moon;When this Pokémon sights its prey, it swirls its ribbonlike feelers as a distraction. A moment later, it pounces.
11261;700;Ultra Sun;Once a fight breaks out, it will unflinchingly charge at dragon Pokémon that are many times larger than itself.
11262;700;Ultra Moon;Sylveon wraps its ribbonlike feelers around its Trainer’s arm because this touch enables it to read its Trainer’s feelings.
11263;700;Sword;By releasing enmity-erasing waves from its ribbonlike feelers, Sylveon stops any conflict.
11264;700;Shield;There’s a Galarian fairy tale that describes a beautiful Sylveon vanquishing a dreadful dragon Pokémon.
11265;701;X,Omega Ruby;Although its body is small, its proficient fighting skills enable it to keep up with big bruisers like Machamp and Hariyama.
11266;701;Y,Alpha Sapphire;With its wings, it controls its position in the air. It likes to attack from above, a maneuver that is difficult to defend against.
11267;701;Ultra Sun;It overwhelms opponents with quick moves, but sometimes it showboats for too long when it’s using a special move and gets itself into a pinch.
11268;701;Ultra Moon;In combat, Hawlucha leaps nimbly about, taking advantage of its opponents’ blind spots. It’s also skilled at using superb submission holds.
11269;701;Sword;It drives its opponents to exhaustion with its agile maneuvers, then ends the fight with a flashy finishing move.
11270;701;Shield;It always strikes a pose before going for its finishing move. Sometimes opponents take advantage of that time to counterattack.
11271;702;X,Omega Ruby;Its whiskers serve as antennas. By sending and receiving electrical waves, it can communicate with others over vast distances.
11272;702;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It uses its tail to absorb electricity from power plants or from outlets in houses, and then it fires the electricity from its whiskers.
11273;702;Ultra Sun;It sneaks into people’s homes and steals electricity from their outlets. When your electric bill seems off, it’s the handiwork of this rascal.
11274;702;Ultra Moon;Its upper whiskers are sensors that survey its surroundings. Its lower whiskers are organs that shoot electricity.
11275;702;Sword;A Dedenne’s whiskers pick up electrical waves other Dedenne send out. These Pokémon share locations of food or electricity with one another.
11276;702;Shield;Since Dedenne can’t generate much electricity on its own, it steals electricity from outlets or other electric Pokémon.
11277;703;X,Omega Ruby;Born from the temperatures and pressures deep underground, it fires beams from the stone in its head.
11278;703;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It has slept underground for hundreds of millions of years since its birth. It’s occasionally found during the excavation of caves.
11279;703;Sun;Born from the high temperatures and pressures deep underground, it defends itself by firing beams from the jewel part of its body.
11280;703;Moon;Although this Pokémon is not especially rare, its glittering, jewel-draped body draws attention from people.
11281;703;Ultra Sun;Some say that deep beneath the surface of the world, a pack of Carbink live with their queen in a kingdom of jewels.
11282;703;Ultra Moon;To keep the jewels on their bodies free of tarnish, packs of Carbink use their soft manes to polish one another’s jewels.
11283;703;Sword;When beset by attackers, Carbink wipes them all out by firing high-energy beams from the gems embedded in its body.
11284;703;Shield;It’s said that somewhere in the world, there’s a mineral vein housing a large pack of slumbering Carbink. It’s also said that this pack has a queen.
11285;704;X,Omega Ruby;The weakest Dragon-type Pokémon, it lives in damp, shady places, so its body doesn’t dry out.
11286;704;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It’s covered in a slimy membrane that makes any punches or kicks slide off it harmlessly.
11287;704;Sun;The weakest of all Dragon-type Pokémon, it’s unable to breathe if its skin dries out, so it sticks to shady places.
11288;704;Moon;Its source of protection is its slimy, germ-laden mucous membrane. Anyone who touches it needs some thorough hand-washing.
11289;704;Ultra Sun;It uses its horns to check out its surroundings. They’re very sensitive, so if you grab them, it will feel a strong shock and be unable to move.
11290;704;Ultra Moon;Its body is mostly water. If it dries out, it will die, so it’s always sitting with perfect stillness in the shade.
11291;704;Sword;Because most of its body is water, it will dry up if the weather becomes too arid. It’s considered the weakest dragon Pokémon.
11292;704;Shield;Their horns are powerful sensors. As soon as Goomy pick up any sign of enemies, they go into hiding. This is how they’ve survived.
11293;705;X,Omega Ruby;It drives away opponents by excreting a sticky liquid that can dissolve anything. Its eyes devolved, so it can’t see anything.
11294;705;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Its four horns are a high-performance radar system. It uses them to sense sounds and smells, rather than using ears or a nose.
11295;705;Sun;It has trouble drawing a line between friends and food. It will calmly try to melt and eat even those it gets along well with.
11296;705;Moon;This Pokémon’s mucous can dissolve anything. Toothless, it sprays mucous on its prey. Once they’re nicely dissolved, it slurps them up.
11297;705;Ultra Sun;It crawls along sluggishly. The swirly protrusion on its back is filled with its brain and other organs.
11298;705;Ultra Moon;Its entire body is covered with gooey mucus that can dissolve anything. Be sure to put gloves on if you’re going to touch it.
11299;705;Sword;Although this Pokémon isn’t very strong, its body is coated in a caustic slime that can melt through anything, so predators steer clear of it.
11300;705;Shield;The lump on its back contains its tiny brain. It thinks only of food and escaping its enemies.
11301;706;X,Omega Ruby;This very friendly Dragon-type Pokémon will hug its beloved Trainer, leaving that Trainer covered in sticky slime.
11302;706;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It attacks with retractable horns. It throws a punch that’s the equivalent of the force of a hundred pro boxers.
11303;706;Sun;An amazingly friendly Pokémon, but if left to itself, loneliness overcomes it, and it oozes gooey tears.
11304;706;Moon;It gets picked on because it’s meek. But then, whoever teased it gets to feel the full force of its horns and a good swatting from its thick tail.
11305;706;Ultra Sun;It’s very friendly toward people. If you grow close to it, Goodra will hug you with its sticky, slime-covered body. Don’t get mad.
11306;706;Ultra Moon;Underneath its slimy skin is a thick layer of fat, and the combination of the two makes enemies’ attacks slide right off.
11307;706;Sword;Sometimes it misunderstands instructions and appears dazed or bewildered. Many Trainers don’t mind, finding this behavior to be adorable.
11308;706;Shield;Its form of offense is forcefully stretching out its horns. The strikes land 100 times harder than any blow from a heavyweight boxer.
11309;707;X,Omega Ruby;These key collectors threaten any attackers by fiercely jingling their keys at them.
11310;707;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It never lets go of a key that it likes, so people give it the keys to vaults and safes as a way to prevent crime.
11311;707;Sun;This even-tempered Pokémon has a habit of collecting keys. It will sneak into people’s homes to steal their keys.
11312;707;Moon;It inserts its horn into chinks in metal, absorbing metal ions. For some reason, it collects keys.
11313;707;Ultra Sun;Although it’s unclear why it collects keys, giving it a key makes Klefki very happy. However, it apparently only likes master keys.
11314;707;Ultra Moon;Long ago it lived in mines, but once the minerals that make up its diet became scarcer, Klefki began appearing in human settlements.
11315;707;Sword;This Pokémon is constantly collecting keys. Entrust a Klefki with important keys, and the Pokémon will protect them no matter what.
11316;707;Shield;Klefki sucks in metal ions with the horn topping its head. It seems this Pokémon loves keys so much that its head needed to look like one, too.
11317;708;X,Omega Ruby;These Pokémon are created when spirits possess rotten tree stumps. They prefer to live in abandoned forests.
11318;708;Y,Alpha Sapphire;According to old tales, these Pokémon are stumps possessed by the spirits of children who died while lost in the forest.
11319;708;Sun;These Pokémon are stumps possessed by the spirits of children who died in the forest. Their cries sound like eerie screams.
11320;708;Moon;According to legend, medicine to cure any illness can be made by plucking the green leaves on its head, brewing them, and boiling down the liquid.
11321;708;Ultra Sun;By imitating the voice of a child, it causes people to get hopelessly lost deep in the forest. It’s trying to make friends with them.
11322;708;Ultra Moon;An unknown spirit came to lodge in a tree stump, creating this Pokémon. A cure-all can be made from an infusion of its green leaves.
11323;708;Sword;After a lost child perished in the forest, their spirit possessed a tree stump, causing the spirit’s rebirth as this Pokémon.
11324;708;Shield;With a voice like a human child’s, it cries out to lure adults deep into the forest, getting them lost among the trees.
11325;709;X,Omega Ruby;It can control trees at will. It will trap people who harm the forest, so they can never leave.
11326;709;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Using its roots as a nervous system, it controls the trees in the forest. It’s kind to the Pokémon that reside in its body.
11327;709;Sun;This Pokémon is said to devour anyone daring to ravage the forest. To the creatures dwelling in the forest, it offers great kindness.
11328;709;Moon;Through its roots, it exerts control over other trees. A deadly curse falls upon anyone cutting down trees in forests where Trevenant dwell.
11329;709;Ultra Sun;It’s feared as a ghost of the forest. Lumberjacks bring along Fire types, which Trevenant hates, when they enter the forest.
11330;709;Ultra Moon;This Pokémon controls trees via roots stretching from its feet, and it will attack anyone that dares to ravage the forest.
11331;709;Sword;People fear it due to a belief that it devours any who try to cut down trees in its forest, but to the Pokémon it shares its woods with, it’s kind.
11332;709;Shield;Small roots that extend from the tips of this Pokémon’s feet can tie into the trees of the forest and give Trevenant control over them.
11333;710;X,Omega Ruby;The pumpkin body is inhabited by a spirit trapped in this world. As the sun sets, it becomes restless and active.
11334;710;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It is said to carry wandering spirits to the place where they belong so they can move on.
11335;710;X,Omega Ruby;The pumpkin body is inhabited by a spirit trapped in this world. As the sun sets, it becomes restless and active.
11336;710;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It is said to carry wandering spirits to the place where they belong so they can move on.
11337;710;X,Omega Ruby;The pumpkin body is inhabited by a spirit trapped in this world. As the sun sets, it becomes restless and active.
11338;710;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It is said to carry wandering spirits to the place where they belong so they can move on.
11339;710;X,Omega Ruby;The pumpkin body is inhabited by a spirit trapped in this world. As the sun sets, it becomes restless and active.
11340;710;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It is said to carry wandering spirits to the place where they belong so they can move on.
11341;711;X,Omega Ruby;Singing in eerie voices, they wander town streets on the night of the new moon. Anyone who hears their song is cursed.
11342;711;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It enwraps its prey in its hairlike arms. It sings joyfully as it observes the suffering of its prey.
11343;711;X,Omega Ruby;Singing in eerie voices, they wander town streets on the night of the new moon. Anyone who hears their song is cursed.
11344;711;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It enwraps its prey in its hairlike arms. It sings joyfully as it observes the suffering of its prey.
11345;711;X,Omega Ruby;Singing in eerie voices, they wander town streets on the night of the new moon. Anyone who hears their song is cursed.
11346;711;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It enwraps its prey in its hairlike arms. It sings joyfully as it observes the suffering of its prey.
11347;711;X,Omega Ruby;Singing in eerie voices, they wander town streets on the night of the new moon. Anyone who hears their song is cursed.
11348;711;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It enwraps its prey in its hairlike arms. It sings joyfully as it observes the suffering of its prey.
11349;712;X,Omega Ruby;It blocks opponents’ attacks with the ice that shields its body. It uses cold air to repair any cracks with new ice.
11350;712;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Using air of -150 degrees Fahrenheit, they freeze opponents solid. They live in herds above the snow line on mountains.
11351;712;Sword;They chill the air around them to −150 degrees Fahrenheit, freezing the water in the air into ice that they use as armor.
11352;712;Shield;This Pokémon lives in areas of frigid cold. It secures itself to the back of an Avalugg by freezing its feet in place.
11353;713;X,Omega Ruby;Its ice-covered body is as hard as steel. Its cumbersome frame crushes anything that stands in its way.
11354;713;Y,Alpha Sapphire;The way several Bergmite huddle on its back makes it look like an aircraft carrier made of ice.
11355;713;Sword;At high latitudes, this Pokémon can be found with clusters of Bergmite on its back as it swims among the icebergs.
11356;713;Shield;As Avalugg moves about during the day, the cracks in its body deepen. The Pokémon’s body returns to a pristine state overnight.
11357;714;X,Omega Ruby;They live in pitch-black caves. Their enormous ears can emit ultrasonic waves of 200,000 hertz.
11358;714;Y,Alpha Sapphire;Even a robust wrestler will become dizzy and unable to stand when exposed to its 200,000-hertz ultrasonic waves.
11359;714;Ultra Sun;Fruits are its favorite foods. This gourmet carefully picks out just the ripe ones using its sonar.
11360;714;Ultra Moon;It flies around in search of fruit to eat. It uses ultrasonic waves to detect which fruits are ripe.
11361;714;Sword;After nightfall, they emerge from the caves they nest in during the day. Using their ultrasonic waves, they go on the hunt for ripened fruit.
11362;714;Shield;No wavelength of sound is beyond Noibat’s ability to produce. The ultrasonic waves it generates can overcome much larger Pokémon.
11363;715;X,Omega Ruby;They fly around on moonless nights and attack careless prey. Nothing can beat them in a battle in the dark.
11364;715;Y,Alpha Sapphire;The ultrasonic waves it emits from its ears can reduce a large boulder to pebbles. It swoops out of the dark to attack.
11365;715;Ultra Sun;Although it has a violent disposition, if you give it a nice ripe fruit that it loves, Noivern will suddenly become tame.
11366;715;Ultra Moon;This hot-blooded Pokémon attacks anything it sees with ultrasonic waves that can crush boulders.
11367;715;Sword;Aggressive and cruel, this Pokémon will ruthlessly torment enemies that are helpless in the dark.
11368;715;Shield;Flying through the darkness, it weakens enemies with ultrasonic waves that could crush stone. Its fangs finish the fight.
11369;716;X,Omega Ruby;Legends say it can share eternal life. It slept for a thousand years in the form of a tree before its revival.
11370;716;Y,Alpha Sapphire;When the horns on its head shine in seven colors, it is said to be sharing everlasting life.
11371;717;X,Omega Ruby;When this legendary Pokémon’s wings and tail feathers spread wide and glow red, it absorbs the life force of living creatures.
11372;717;Y,Alpha Sapphire;When its life comes to an end, it absorbs the life energy of every living thing and turns into a cocoon once more.
11373;718;X,Omega Ruby;When the Kalos region’s ecosystem falls into disarray, it appears and reveals its secret power.
11374;718;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It’s hypothesized that it’s monitoring those who destroy the ecosystem from deep in the cave where it lives.
11375;718;Sun;This is Zygarde’s form when it has gathered 50% of its cells. It wipes out all those who oppose it, showing not a shred of mercy.
11376;718;Moon;It’s thought to be monitoring the ecosystem. There are rumors that even greater power lies hidden within it.
11377;718;Ultra Sun;This is Zygarde’s form when about half of its pieces have been assembled. It plays the role of monitoring the ecosystem.
11378;718;Ultra Moon;Some say it can change to an even more powerful form when battling those who threaten the ecosystem.
11379;718;X,Omega Ruby;When the Kalos region’s ecosystem falls into disarray, it appears and reveals its secret power.
11380;718;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It’s hypothesized that it’s monitoring those who destroy the ecosystem from deep in the cave where it lives.
11381;718;Sun;This is Zygarde’s form when it has gathered 50% of its cells. It wipes out all those who oppose it, showing not a shred of mercy.

11384;718;Ultra Moon;Some say it can change to an even more powerful form when battling those who threaten the ecosystem.
11385;718;X,Omega Ruby;When the Kalos region’s ecosystem falls into disarray, it appears and reveals its secret power.

11390;718;Ultra Moon;Some say it can change to an even more powerful form when battling those who threaten the ecosystem.
11391;719;X,Omega Ruby;A sudden transformation of Carbink, its pink, glimmering body is said to be the loveliest sight in the whole world.
11392;719;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It can instantly create many diamonds by compressing the carbon in the air between its hands.

11395;720;X;This troublemaker sends anything and everything to faraway places using its loop, which can warp space.
11396;720;Y;It gathers things it likes and passes them through its loop to teleport them to a secret place.
11397;720;Omega Ruby;In its true form, it possess a huge amount of power. Legends of its avarice tell how it once carried off an entire castle to gain the treasure hidden within.
11398;720;Alpha Sapphire;It is said to be able to seize anything it desires with its six rings and six huge arms. With its power sealed, it is transformed into a much smaller form.

11403;721;X,Omega Ruby;It lets out billows of steam and disappears into the dense fog. It’s said to live in mountains where humans do not tread.
11404;721;Y,Alpha Sapphire;It expels its internal steam from the arms on its back. It has enough power to blow away a mountain.
11405;722;Sun;This wary Pokémon uses photosynthesis to store up energy during the day, while becoming active at night.
11406;722;Moon;Silently it glides, drawing near its targets. Before they even notice it, it begins to pelt them with vicious kicks.
11407;722;Ultra Sun;It sends its feathers, which are as sharp as blades, flying in attack. Its legs are strong, so its kicks are also formidable.
11408;722;Ultra Moon;It feels relaxed in tight, dark places and has been known to use its Trainer’s pocket or bag as a nest.
11409;722;Sword;At a distance, it launches its sharp feathers while flying about. If the enemy gets too close, Rowlet switches tactics and delivers vicious kicks.
11410;722;Shield;During the day, it builds up energy via photosynthesis. At night, it flies silently through the sky, on the prowl for prey.
11411;723;Sun;A bit of a dandy, it spends its free time preening its wings. Its preoccupation with any dirt on its plumage can leave it unable to battle.
11412;723;Moon;It throws sharp feathers called blade quills at enemies or prey. It seldom misses.
11413;723;Ultra Sun;This narcissistic Pokémon is a clean freak. If you don’t groom it diligently, it will stop listening to you.
11414;723;Ultra Moon;Supremely sensitive to the presence of others, it can detect opponents standing behind it, flinging its sharp feathers to take them out.
11415;723;Sword;It throws one knifelike feather after another at its enemies, and each one precisely strikes a weak point. These feathers are known as blade quills.
11416;723;Shield;It never slacks when it comes to the task of cleaning its feathers. Thorough preening keeps it looking spiffy and its blade quills nice and sharp.
11417;724;Sun;It fires arrow quills from its wings with such precision, they can pierce a pebble at distances over a hundred yards.
11418;724;Moon;Although basically cool and cautious, when it’s caught by surprise, it’s seized by panic.
11419;724;Ultra Sun;It nocks its arrow quills and shoots them at opponents. When it simply can’t afford to miss, it tugs the vine on its head to improve its focus.
11420;724;Ultra Moon;Decidueye can nock and fire an arrow at an enemy in a tenth of a second, so its battles are decided in the blink of an eye.
11421;724;Sword;As if wielding a bow, it launches the arrow quills hidden among the feathers of its wings. Decidueye’s shots never miss.
11422;724;Shield;In a tenth of a second, it can nock and fire an arrow quill, piercing an opponent’s weak point before they notice what’s happening.
11423;725;Sun;While grooming itself, it builds up fur inside its stomach. It sets the fur alight and spews fiery attacks, which change based on how it coughs.
11424;725;Moon;It doesn’t allow its emotions to be easily seen. Earning its trust takes time. It prefers solitude.
11425;725;Ultra Sun;If you try too hard to get close to it, it won’t open up to you. Even if you do grow close, giving it too much affection is still a no-no.
11426;725;Ultra Moon;Its coat regrows twice a year. When the time comes, Litten sets its own body on fire and burns away the old fur.
11427;725;Sword;It spends even the smallest amount of downtime grooming its fur with its tongue. Loose fur gathers in its stomach and serves as fuel for fiery moves.
11428;725;Shield;Trying to pet Litten before it trusts you will result in a nasty scratch from its sharp claws. Be careful.
11429;726;Sun;At its throat, it bears a bell of fire. The bell rings brightly whenever this Pokémon spits fire.
11430;726;Moon;It boasts powerful front legs. With a single punch, it can bend an iron bar right over.
11431;726;Ultra Sun;It can act spoiled if it grows close to its Trainer. A powerful Pokémon, its sharp claws can leave its Trainer’s whole body covered in scratches.
11432;726;Ultra Moon;When its mane is standing on end, you can tell it’s feeling good. When it isn’t feeling well, its fur will lie down flat.
11433;726;Sword;In the midst of battle, the fire pouch on Torracat’s neck rings like a bell and produces stronger flames than usual.
11434;726;Shield;When facing a powerful enemy, Torracat’s fighting spirit gets pumped up, and its fire bell blazes hotter.
11435;727;Sun;This Pokémon has a violent, selfish disposition. If it’s not in the mood to listen, it will ignore its Trainer’s orders with complete nonchalance.
11436;727;Moon;After hurling ferocious punches and flinging furious kicks, it finishes opponents off by spewing fire from around its navel.
11437;727;Ultra Sun;Although it’s rough mannered and egotistical, it finds beating down unworthy opponents boring. It gets motivated for stronger opponents.
11438;727;Ultra Moon;When its fighting spirit is set alight, the flames around its waist become especially intense.
11439;727;Sword;It excels at violent, no-holds-barred battles. The temperature of the flames that issue from its navel exceeds 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
11440;727;Shield;Incineroar’s rough and aggressive behavior is its most notable trait, but the way it helps out small Pokémon shows that it has a kind side as well.
11441;728;Sun;This Pokémon snorts body fluids from its nose, blowing balloons to smash into its foes. It’s famous for being a hard worker.
11442;728;Moon;This Pokémon can control water bubbles. It practices diligently so it can learn to make big bubbles.
11443;728;Ultra Sun;The balloons it inflates with its nose grow larger and larger as it practices day by day.
11444;728;Ultra Moon;Popplio gets on top of its bouncy water balloons to jump higher. It’s quite the acrobatic fighter!
11445;728;Sword;It creates special bouncy balloons to send at its opponents. When the balloons pop, the sheer force of their bursting is what deals damage.
11446;728;Shield;If Popplio want to create big, powerful balloons, they must be persistent. It takes daily practice for these Pokémon to develop their skills.
11447;729;Sun;A skillful dancer, it creates a sequence of water balloons as it dances, and briskly bombards its enemies.
11448;729;Moon;It cares deeply for its companions. When its Trainer is feeling down, it performs a cheery dance to try and help.
11449;729;Ultra Sun;It gets excited when it sees a dance it doesn’t know. This hard worker practices diligently until it can learn that dance.
11450;729;Ultra Moon;It attacks by smacking its enemies with the exploding water balloons that it creates.
11451;729;Sword;As if dancing, it artfully dodges the attacks of its enemies. All the while, it’s busy forming a bunch of balloons to overwhelm its foes.
11452;729;Shield;On nights when the sea is calm, Brionne dance with one another to the singing of the Primarina that’s leading them.
11453;730;Sun;It controls its water balloons with song. The melody is learned from others of its kind and is passed down from one generation to the next.
11454;730;Moon;Its singing voice is its chief weapon in battle. This Pokémon’s Trainer must prioritize the daily maintenance of its throat at all costs.
11455;730;Ultra Sun;To Primarina, every battle is a stage. It takes down its prey with beautiful singing and dancing.
11456;730;Ultra Moon;Also known as a songstress, it has a fantastical look on moonlit nights when it leads its colony in song.
11457;730;Sword;With its mouth, it makes sonic waves that sound like beautiful singing. It uses the sonic waves to control its water balloons.
11458;730;Shield;For Primarina, every battle’s a stage. Its singing and the dancing of its balloons will mesmerize the audience.
11459;731;Sun;It can peck at a rate of 16 times a second to drill holes in trees. It uses the holes for food storage and for nesting.
11460;731;Moon;This Pokémon feeds on berries, whose leftover seeds become the ammunition for the attacks it fires off from its mouth.
11461;731;Ultra Sun;It pecks at trees with its hard beak. You can get some idea of its mood or condition from the rhythm of its pecking.
11462;731;Ultra Moon;It may look spindly, but its neck muscles are heavy-duty. It can peck at a tree 16 times per second!
11463;732;Sun;It eats berries and stores their seeds in its beak. When it encounters enemies or prey, it fires off all the seeds in a burst.
11464;732;Moon;By bending its beak, it can produce a variety of calls and brand itself a noisy nuisance for its neighbors.
11465;732;Ultra Sun;It can bend the tip of its beak to produce over a hundred different cries at will.
11466;732;Ultra Moon;From its mouth, it fires the seeds of berries it has eaten. The scattered seeds give rise to new plants.
11467;733;Sun;When it battles, its beak heats up. The temperature can easily exceed 212 degrees Fahrenheit, causing severe burns when it hits.
11468;733;Moon;Within its beak, its internal gas ignites, explosively launching seeds with enough power to pulverize boulders.
11469;733;Ultra Sun;They smack beaks with others of their kind to communicate. The strength and number of hits tell each other how they feel.
11470;733;Ultra Moon;Known for forming harmonious couples, this Pokémon is brought to wedding ceremonies as a good luck charm.
11471;734;Sun;With its sharp fangs, it will bite anything. It did not originally live in Alola but was imported from another region.
11472;734;Moon;It wanders around in a never-ending search for food. At dusk, it collapses from exhaustion and falls asleep on the spot.
11473;734;Ultra Sun;Its stomach takes up most of its long torso. It’s a big eater, so the amount Trainers have to spend on its food is no laughing matter.
11474;734;Ultra Moon;Although it will eat anything, it prefers fresh living things, so it marches down streets in search of prey.
11475;735;Sun;When it finds a trace of its prey, it patiently stakes out the location...but it’s always snoozing by nightfall.
11476;735;Moon;It adores having Rattata and Raticate for dinner, but as it’s diurnal, it never encounters them. This Pokémon boasts incredible patience.
11477;735;Ultra Sun;Although it wasn’t originally found in Alola, this Pokémon was brought over a long time ago when there was a huge Rattata outbreak.
11478;735;Ultra Moon;Patient by nature, this Pokémon loses control of itself and pounces when it spots its favorite meal—Rattata!
11479;736;Sun;Its strong jaw enables it to scrape trees and slurp out the sap. It normally lives underground.
11480;736;Moon;They often gather near places frequented by electric Pokémon in order to avoid being attacked by bird Pokémon.
11481;736;Ultra Sun;If you find its nest, you shouldn’t stick your hand inside. You’ll get bitten by an irritated Grubbin.
11482;736;Ultra Moon;It spits a sticky thread to stop opponents in their tracks, and then it grabs them in its sharp, sturdy mandibles to take them down.
11483;736;Sword;Its natural enemies, like Rookidee, may flee rather than risk getting caught in its large mandibles that can snap thick tree branches.
11484;736;Shield;It uses its big jaws to dig nests into the forest floor, and it loves to feed on sweet tree sap.
11485;737;Sun;Its body is capable of storing electricity. On camping trips, people are grateful to have one around.
11486;737;Moon;From the food it digests, it generates electricity, and it stores this energy in its electric sac.
11487;737;Ultra Sun;It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely moves, munching away on humus. If you accidentally step on one, you’ll get a shock!
11488;737;Ultra Moon;Its stout shell provides excellent defense from attacks. It uses electricity on persistent opponents.
11489;737;Sword;While its durable shell protects it from attacks, Charjabug strikes at enemies with jolts of electricity discharged from the tips of its jaws.
11490;737;Shield;Its digestive processes convert the leaves it eats into electricity. An electric sac in its belly stores the electricity for later use.
11491;738;Sun;It zips around, on sharp lookout for an opening. It concentrates electrical energy within its large jaws and uses it to zap its enemies.
11492;738;Moon;It produces electricity via an electrical organ in its abdomen. It overwhelms bird Pokémon with shocking beams of electrical energy.
11493;738;Ultra Sun;It has an organ that generates electricity in its abdomen. It concentrates energy in its strong jaws and fires off powerful jolts of electricity.
11494;738;Ultra Moon;Vikavolt flusters opponents with acrobatic flying maneuvers. This creates an opening for it to deliver an electric beam attack.
11495;738;Sword;It builds up electricity in its abdomen, focuses it through its jaws, and then fires the electricity off in concentrated beams.
11496;738;Shield;If it carries a Charjabug to use as a spare battery, a flying Vikavolt can rapidly fire high-powered beams of electricity.
11497;739;Sun;While guarding its weak points with its pincers, it looks for an opening and unleashes punches. When it loses, it foams at the mouth and faints.
11498;739;Moon;It punches so much, its pincers often come off from overuse, but they grow back quickly. What little meat they contain is rich and delicious.
11499;739;Ultra Sun;Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense and defense. Fights between two Crabrawler are like boxing matches.
11500;739;Ultra Moon;Crabrawler has been known to mistake Exeggutor for a coconut tree and climb it. The enraged Exeggutor shakes it off and stomps it.
11501;740;Sun;It aimed for the top but got lost and ended up on a snowy mountain. Being forced to endure the cold, this Pokémon evolved and grew fur.
11502;740;Moon;It just throws punches indiscriminately. In times of desperation, it can lop off its own pincers and fire them like rockets.
11503;740;Ultra Sun;It stores coldness in its pincers and pummels its foes. It can even smash thick walls of ice to bits!
11504;740;Ultra Moon;Before it stops to think, it just starts pummeling. There are records of its turning back avalanches with a flurry of punches.
11505;741;Sun;It beats its wings together to create fire. As it moves in the steps of its beautiful dance, it bathes opponents in intense flames.
11506;741;Moon;This Oricorio has sipped red nectar. Its passionate dance moves cause its enemies to combust in both body and mind.
11507;741;Ultra Sun;It wins the hearts of its enemies with its passionate dancing and then uses the opening it creates to burn them up with blazing flames.
11508;741;Ultra Moon;This Oricorio has drunk red nectar. If its Trainer gives the wrong order, this passionate Pokémon becomes fiercely angry.
11509;741;Sun;It beats its wings together to create fire. As it moves in the steps of its beautiful dance, it bathes opponents in intense flames.
11510;741;Moon;This Oricorio has sipped red nectar. Its passionate dance moves cause its enemies to combust in both body and mind.
11511;741;Ultra Sun;It wins the hearts of its enemies with its passionate dancing and then uses the opening it creates to burn them up with blazing flames.
11512;741;Ultra Moon;This Oricorio has drunk red nectar. If its Trainer gives the wrong order, this passionate Pokémon becomes fiercely angry.
11513;741;Sun;It beats its wings together to create fire. As it moves in the steps of its beautiful dance, it bathes opponents in intense flames.
11514;741;Moon;This Oricorio has sipped red nectar. Its passionate dance moves cause its enemies to combust in both body and mind.
11515;741;Ultra Sun;It wins the hearts of its enemies with its passionate dancing and then uses the opening it creates to burn them up with blazing flames.
11516;741;Ultra Moon;This Oricorio has drunk red nectar. If its Trainer gives the wrong order, this passionate Pokémon becomes fiercely angry.
11517;741;Sun;It beats its wings together to create fire. As it moves in the steps of its beautiful dance, it bathes opponents in intense flames.
11518;741;Moon;This Oricorio has sipped red nectar. Its passionate dance moves cause its enemies to combust in both body and mind.
11519;741;Ultra Sun;It wins the hearts of its enemies with its passionate dancing and then uses the opening it creates to burn them up with blazing flames.
11520;741;Ultra Moon;This Oricorio has drunk red nectar. If its Trainer gives the wrong order, this passionate Pokémon becomes fiercely angry.
11521;742;Sun;It feeds on the nectar and pollen of flowers. Because it’s able to sense auras, it can identify which flowers are about to bloom.
11522;742;Moon;Myriads of Cutiefly flutter above the heads of people who have auras resembling those of flowers.
11523;742;Ultra Sun;Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. In fields of flowers, it gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food.
11524;742;Ultra Moon;Cutiefly can pick up the auras of living things. It skillfully reads those auras to predict its foes’ movements and make fools of them.
11525;742;Sword;Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. You can find Cutiefly hovering around Gossifleur, trying to get some of Gossifleur’s pollen.
11526;742;Shield;An opponent’s aura can tell Cutiefly what that opponent’s next move will be. Then Cutiefly can glide around the attack and strike back.
11527;743;Sun;It rolls up pollen into puffs. It makes many different varieties, some used as food and others used in battle.
11528;743;Moon;Some of Ribombee’s pollen puffs are highly nutritious. They are sometimes sold as supplements.
11529;743;Ultra Sun;Rain makes pollen damp, so Ribombee hates rain. When it sees ominous clouds, it finds a hollow in a tree, where it waits stock-still.
11530;743;Ultra Moon;It can predict the weather from moisture levels and wind direction. Ribombee only reveals itself when there are a few clear days in a row.
11531;743;Sword;It makes pollen puffs from pollen and nectar. The puffs’ effects depend on the type of ingredients and how much of each one is used.
11532;743;Shield;Ribombee absolutely hate getting wet or rained on. In the cloudy Galar region, they are very seldom seen.
11533;744;Sun;It’s considered to be a good Pokémon for beginners because of its friendliness, but its disposition grows rougher as it grows up.
11534;744;Moon;This Pokémon has lived with people since times long ago. It can sense when its Trainer is in the dumps and will stick close by its Trainer’s side.
11535;744;Ultra Sun;As they develop, their disposition grows more violent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them too much to handle and abandon them.
11536;744;Ultra Moon;When it rubs the rocks on its neck against you, that’s proof of its love for you. However, the rocks are sharp, so the gesture is quite painful!
11537;744;Sword;This Pokémon can bond very strongly with its Trainer, but it also has a habit of biting. Raising a Rockruff for a long time can be challenging.
11538;744;Shield;This Pokémon intimidates opponents by striking the ground with the rocks on its neck. The moment an opponent flinches, Rockruff attacks.
11539;744;Sun;It’s considered to be a good Pokémon for beginners because of its friendliness, but its disposition grows rougher as it grows up.

11544;744;Shield;This Pokémon intimidates opponents by striking the ground with the rocks on its neck. The moment an opponent flinches, Rockruff attacks.
11545;745;Sun;Its quick movements confuse its enemies. Well equipped with claws and fangs, it also uses the sharp rocks in its mane as weapons.
11546;745;Moon;When properly raised from a young age, it will become a trustworthy partner that will absolutely never betray its Trainer.
11547;745;Ultra Sun;The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives. Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees before finishing them off.
11548;745;Ultra Moon;The rocks in its mane are sharper than a knife. Fragments that break off are treasured as good luck charms.
11549;745;Sun;Its quick movements confuse its enemies. Well equipped with claws and fangs, it also uses the sharp rocks in its mane as weapons.
11550;745;Moon;When properly raised from a young age, it will become a trustworthy partner that will absolutely never betray its Trainer.

11555;745;Ultra Sun;The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives. Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees before finishing them off.
11556;745;Ultra Moon;The rocks in its mane are sharper than a knife. Fragments that break off are treasured as good luck charms.
11557;746;Sun;When it’s in trouble, its eyes moisten and begin to shine. The shining light attracts its comrades, and they stand together against their enemies.
11558;746;Moon;It’s awfully weak and notably tasty, so everyone is always out to get it. As it happens, anyone trying to bully it receives a painful lesson.
11559;746;Ultra Sun;They’re weak, so they move in schools. However, they can also often be seen all alone, having strayed from the school.
11560;746;Ultra Moon;When it’s in a jam, its shining eyes attract others of its kind. The light from its eyes is visible almost 25 miles away.
11561;746;Sword;Individually, they’re incredibly weak. It’s by gathering up into schools that they’re able to confront opponents.
11562;746;Shield;When it senses danger, its eyes tear up. The sparkle of its tears signals other Wishiwashi to gather.
11563;746;Sun;When it’s in trouble, its eyes moisten and begin to shine. The shining light attracts its comrades, and they stand together against their enemies.
11564;746;Moon;It’s awfully weak and notably tasty, so everyone is always out to get it. As it happens, anyone trying to bully it receives a painful lesson.

11567;746;Sword;Individually, they’re incredibly weak. It’s by gathering up into schools that they’re able to confront opponents.
11568;746;Shield;When it senses danger, its eyes tear up. The sparkle of its tears signals other Wishiwashi to gather.
11569;747;Sun;It plunges the poison spike on its head into its prey. When the prey has weakened, Mareanie deals the finishing blow with its 10 tentacles.
11570;747;Moon;It’s found crawling on beaches and seafloors. The coral that grows on Corsola’s head is as good as a five-star banquet to this Pokémon.
11571;747;Ultra Sun;They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola branches that have naturally fallen off.
11572;747;Ultra Moon;Aside from its head, its body parts regenerate quickly if they’re cut off. After a good night’s sleep, Mareanie is back to normal.
11573;747;Sword;The first symptom of its sting is numbness. The next is an itching sensation so intense that it’s impossible to resist the urge to claw at your skin.
11574;747;Shield;Unlike their Alolan counterparts, the Mareanie of the Galar region have not yet figured out that the branches of Corsola are delicious.
11575;748;Sun;Toxapex crawls along the ocean floor on its 12 legs. It leaves a trail of Corsola bits scattered in its wake.
11576;748;Moon;Those attacked by Toxapex’s poison will suffer intense pain for three days and three nights. Post-recovery, there will be some aftereffects.
11577;748;Ultra Sun;To attack, this Pokémon sends toxic spikes flying at its enemies. Ones that come close get mown down by the claws on its feet.
11578;748;Ultra Moon;With its 12 legs, it creates a dome to shelter within. The flow of the tides doesn’t affect Toxapex in there, so it’s very comfortable.
11579;748;Sword;To survive in the cold waters of Galar, this Pokémon forms a dome with its legs, enclosing its body so it can capture its own body heat.
11580;748;Shield;Within the poison sac in its body is a poison so toxic that Pokémon as large as Wailord will still be suffering three days after it first takes effect.
11581;749;Sun;The mud stuck to Mudbray’s hooves enhances its grip and its powerful running gait.
11582;749;Moon;It has a stubborn, individualistic disposition. Eating dirt, making mud, and playing in the mire all form part of its daily routine.
11583;749;Ultra Sun;It loves playing in the mud. If it isn’t showered with mud on a daily basis, it gets stressed out and stops listening to its Trainer.
11584;749;Ultra Moon;Possessing mighty power, Mudbray can be loaded with 50 times its own body weight and will be totally fine.
11585;749;Sword;Loads weighing up to 50 times as much as its own body weight pose no issue for this Pokémon. It’s skilled at making use of mud.
11586;749;Shield;It eats dirt to create mud and smears this mud all over its feet, giving them the grip needed to walk on rough terrain without slipping.
11587;750;Sun;It spits a mud that provides resistance to both wind and rain, so the walls of old houses were often coated with it.
11588;750;Moon;Its heavy, mud-covered kicks are its best means of attack, and it can reduce large trucks to scrap without breaking a sweat.
11589;750;Ultra Sun;It remains calm and unmoving no matter the situation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its mouth to make a special kind of mud.
11590;750;Ultra Moon;It can trudge mountain roads without rest for three days and three nights, all the while dragging a 10-ton load.
11591;750;Sword;Mud that hardens around a Mudsdale’s legs sets harder than stone. It’s so hard that it allows this Pokémon to scrap a truck with a single kick.
11592;750;Shield;Mudsdale has so much stamina that it could carry over 10 tons across the Galar region without rest or sleep.
11593;751;Sun;It crawls onto the land in search of food. Its water bubble allows it to breathe and protects its soft head.
11594;751;Moon;When it comes across enemies or potential prey, this Pokémon smashes its water-bubble-covered head into them.
11595;751;Ultra Sun;When two Dewpider meet, they display their water bubbles to each other. Then the one with the smaller bubble gets out of the other’s way.
11596;751;Ultra Moon;It can only breathe oxygen that has dissolved in water, so it wears a water bubble on its head when it walks around on land.
11597;751;Sword;It forms a water bubble at the rear of its body and then covers its head with it. Meeting another Dewpider means comparing water-bubble sizes.
11598;751;Shield;Dewpider normally lives underwater. When it comes onto land in search of food, it takes water with it in the form of a bubble on its head.
11599;752;Sun;It delivers headbutts with the water bubble on its head. Small Pokémon get sucked into the bubble, where they drown.
11600;752;Moon;Despite what its appearance suggests, it cares for others. If it finds vulnerable, weak Pokémon, it protectively brings them into its water bubble.
11601;752;Ultra Sun;It usually passes its time in the water. When its belly is full, it stores its subdued prey in the water bubble on its head.
11602;752;Ultra Moon;It has a habit of storing things it values in its water bubble. If its Trainer doesn’t watch out, Araquanid will try to put them in its bubble!
11603;752;Sword;It launches water bubbles with its legs, drowning prey within the bubbles. This Pokémon can then take its time to savor its meal.
11604;752;Shield;It acts as a caretaker for Dewpider, putting them inside its bubble and letting them eat any leftover food.
11605;753;Sun;During the day, it sleeps and soaks up light. When night falls, it walks around looking for a safer place to sleep.
11606;753;Moon;They give off a sweet and refreshing scent. Cutiefly often gather near the tall grass where Fomantis are hiding.
11607;753;Ultra Sun;When the sun rises, Fomantis spreads its four leaves and bathes in the sunlight. The tip of its head has a pleasant aroma.
11608;753;Ultra Moon;It loves the sunshine. When it basks in the sunlight regularly, it grows up with vivid coloration.
11609;753;Sword;When bathed in sunlight, this Pokémon emits a pleasantly sweet scent, which causes bug Pokémon to gather around it.
11610;753;Shield;During the day, Fomantis basks in sunlight and sleeps peacefully. It wakes and moves around at night.
11611;754;Sun;It requires a lot of effort to maintain Lurantis’s vivid coloring, but some collectors enjoy this work and treat it as their hobby.
11612;754;Moon;It fires beams from its sickle-shaped petals. These beams are powerful enough to cleave through thick metal plates.
11613;754;Ultra Sun;For self-protection, it pretends to be a bug Pokémon. Both of its arms bear keen-edged petals.
11614;754;Ultra Moon;As it slashes into its enemies, it looks like it’s dancing. Its elegant appearance has led some to call it the most glamorous Grass Pokémon.
11615;754;Sword;This Pokémon resembles a beautiful flower. A properly raised Lurantis will have gorgeous, brilliant colors.
11616;754;Shield;The petals on this Pokémon’s arms are thin and super sharp, and they can fire laser beams if Lurantis gathers light first.
11617;755;Sun;It scatters spores that flicker and glow. Anyone seeing these lights falls into a deep slumber.
11618;755;Moon;As it drowses the day away, it nourishes itself by sucking from tree roots. It wakens at the fall of night, wandering off in search of a new tree.
11619;755;Ultra Sun;It scatters its shining spores around itself. Even though they’re dangerous, nighttime tours of forests where Morelull live are popular.
11620;755;Ultra Moon;It likes damp dark places. When night falls, the spores filling the caps of its mushrooms glow.
11621;755;Sword;Pokémon living in the forest eat the delicious caps on Morelull’s head. The caps regrow overnight.
11622;755;Shield;Morelull live in forests that stay dark even during the day. They scatter flickering spores that put enemies to sleep.
11623;756;Sun;Forests where Shiinotic live are treacherous to enter at night. People confused by its strange lights can never find their way home again.
11624;756;Moon;It emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness. When its prey succumb to sleep, this Pokémon feeds on them by sucking in their energy.
11625;756;Ultra Sun;It puts its prey to sleep and siphons off their vitality through the tip of its arms. If one of its kind is weakened, it helps by sending it vitality.
11626;756;Ultra Moon;When it starts fighting for territory with Parasect, the entire area gets completely coated in spores!
11627;756;Sword;Its flickering spores lure in prey and put them to sleep. Once this Pokémon has its prey snoozing, it drains their vitality with its fingertips.
11628;756;Shield;If you see a light deep in a forest at night, don’t go near. Shiinotic will make you fall fast asleep.
11629;757;Sun;It burns its bodily fluids to create a poisonous gas. When its enemies become disoriented from inhaling the gas, it attacks them.
11630;757;Moon;Volcanoes or dry, craggy places are its home. It emanates a sweet-smelling poisonous gas that attracts bug Pokémon, then attacks them.
11631;757;Ultra Sun;The males will do whatever the females tell them. They give the females most of their food. Due to malnutrition, the males can’t evolve.
11632;757;Ultra Moon;It weakens opponents and sends them reeling with its poisonous gas. Salandit doesn’t deal well with Spinda, since it’s always reeling.
11633;757;Sword;Its venom sacs produce a fluid that this Pokémon then heats up with the flame in its tail. This process creates Salandit’s poisonous gas.
11634;757;Shield;This sneaky Pokémon will slink behind its prey and immobilize it with poisonous gas before the prey even realizes Salandit is there.
11635;758;Sun;For some reason, only females have been found. It creates a reverse harem of male Salandit that it lives with.
11636;758;Moon;Filled with pheromones, its poisonous gas can be diluted to use in the production of luscious perfumes.
11637;758;Ultra Sun;Salazzle lives deep in caves and forces the Salandit it has attracted with its pheromones to serve it.
11638;758;Ultra Moon;It punishes Salandit that couldn’t bring it food with a fierce slap of its flame-spewing palm.
11639;758;Sword;Only female Salazzle exist. They emit a gas laden with pheromones to captivate male Salandit.
11640;758;Shield;The winner of competitions between Salazzle is decided by which one has the most male Salandit with it.
11641;759;Sun;Despite its adorable appearance, when it gets angry and flails about, its arms and legs could knock a pro wrestler sprawling.
11642;759;Moon;A touch from anyone except a known friend sends it into a surging frenzy. It’s an incredibly dangerous Pokémon.
11643;759;Ultra Sun;It boasts power enough to split large trees in half. The organ on its rear releases an odor that it uses to communicate with others of its kind.
11644;759;Ultra Moon;Stufful hates to be hugged or touched in any way. It will squirm, thrash, and resist with amazing power.
11645;759;Sword;Its fluffy fur is a delight to pet, but carelessly reaching out to touch this Pokémon could result in painful retaliation.
11646;759;Shield;The way it protects itself by flailing its arms may be an adorable sight, but stay well away. This is flailing that can snap thick tree trunks.
11647;760;Sun;This immensely dangerous Pokémon possesses overwhelming physical strength. Its habitat is generally off-limits.
11648;760;Moon;This Pokémon has the habit of hugging its companions. Many Trainers have left this world after their spines were squashed by its hug.
11649;760;Ultra Sun;It waves its hands wildly in intimidation and warning. Life is over for anyone who doesn’t run away as fast as possible.
11650;760;Ultra Moon;It boasts tremendous physical strength. Many people call it the most dangerous Pokémon in the Alola region.
11651;760;Sword;Once it accepts you as a friend, it tries to show its affection with a hug. Letting it do that is dangerous—it could easily shatter your bones.
11652;760;Shield;The moves it uses to take down its prey would make a martial artist jealous. It tucks subdued prey under its arms to carry them to its nest.
11653;761;Sun;A delectable aroma pours from its body. They are often swallowed whole by Toucannon lured by that wafting deliciousness.
11654;761;Moon;Although it’s too sugary for human consumption, Bounsweet’s sweat can be watered down into a juice with just the right amount of sweetness.
11655;761;Ultra Sun;Because of its sweet, delicious aroma, bird Pokémon are always after it, but it’s not intelligent enough to care.
11656;761;Ultra Moon;It tries to resist being swallowed by a bird Pokémon by spinning the sepals on its head. It’s usually a fruitless attempt.
11657;761;Sword;Its body gives off a sweet, fruity scent that is extremely appetizing to bird Pokémon.
11658;761;Shield;When under attack, it secretes a sweet and delicious sweat. The scent only calls more enemies to it.
11659;762;Sun;The sepals on its head developed to protect its body. These are quite hard, so even if pecked by bird Pokémon, this Pokémon is totally fine.
11660;762;Moon;This Pokémon is always bouncing around energetically. Other Pokémon are attracted by its lively appearance and pleasant aroma.
11661;762;Ultra Sun;It’s protected by its hard sepals, so it plays with bird Pokémon without worry. They peck it relentlessly, but it doesn’t care.
11662;762;Ultra Moon;It bounces around, swinging the sepals on its head with abandon. They’re quite painful when they smack you!
11663;762;Sword;As it twirls like a dancer, a sweet smell spreads out around it. Anyone who inhales the scent will feel a surge of happiness.
11664;762;Shield;Any Corvisquire that pecks at this Pokémon will be greeted with a smack from its sepals followed by a sharp kick.
11665;763;Sun;Its long, striking legs aren’t just for show but to be used to kick with skill. In victory, it shows off by kicking the defeated, laughing boisterously.
11666;763;Moon;A Pokémon known for the beauty of its well-shaped legs, it sometimes appears as a mascot in advertisements for beauty salons.
11667;763;Ultra Sun;A master of grand and beautiful kicks, it can knock out even kickboxing champions with a single blow.
11668;763;Ultra Moon;A Pokémon with an aggressive personality and a mastery of kicking, it cackles every time it kicks an opponent.
11669;763;Sword;This feared Pokémon has long, slender legs and a cruel heart. It shows no mercy as it stomps on its opponents.
11670;763;Shield;A kick from the hardened tips of this Pokémon’s legs leaves a wound in the opponent’s body and soul that will never heal.
11671;764;Sun;It attaches flowers to its highly nutritious vine. This revitalizes the flowers, and they give off an aromatic scent.
11672;764;Moon;Baths prepared with the flowers from its vine have a relaxing effect, so this Pokémon is a hit with many people.
11673;764;Ultra Sun;It stretches sticky vines out from its head and picks flowers to adorn itself with. When it doesn’t have any flowers, it feels uneasy.
11674;764;Ultra Moon;It picks flowers and sticks them to its body with fluids it produces. The aroma that wafts from its petals has a healing effect.
11675;764;Sword;Comfey picks flowers with its vine and decorates itself with them. For some reason, flowers won’t wither once they’re attached to a Comfey.
11676;764;Shield;These Pokémon smell very nice. All Comfey wear different flowers, so each of these Pokémon has its own individual scent.
11677;765;Sun;Known for its extreme intelligence, this Pokémon will look down on inexperienced Trainers, so it’s best suited to veteran Trainers.
11678;765;Moon;Deep in the jungle, high in the lofty canopy, this Pokémon abides. On rare occasions, it shows up at the beach to match wits with Slowking.
11679;765;Ultra Sun;It normally spends its time meditating in the treetops. It throws Poké Balls and gives other Pokémon orders as it pleases.
11680;765;Ultra Moon;Oranguru don’t get along with each other, so they’re always engaging in battles of wits to decide which one is superior.
11681;765;Sword;With waves of its fan—made from leaves and its own fur—Oranguru skillfully gives instructions to other Pokémon.
11682;765;Shield;It knows the forest inside and out. If it comes across a wounded Pokémon, Oranguru will gather medicinal herbs to treat it.
11683;766;Sun;They form groups of roughly 20 individuals. Their mutual bond is remarkable—they will never let down a comrade.
11684;766;Moon;They battle with hard berries for weapons. Their techniques are passed from the boss to the group, generation upon generation.
11685;766;Ultra Sun;They use their saliva to stick leaves to their shoulders. You can tell what troop they belong to from the position of the leaves.
11686;766;Ultra Moon;Berries are its weapons as well as the staple of its diet. The one that can throw a berry the farthest is the boss of the troop.
11687;766;Sword;Displaying amazing teamwork, they follow the orders of their boss as they all help out in the search for their favorite berries.
11688;766;Shield;Passimian live in groups of about 20, with each member performing an assigned role. Through cooperation, the group survives.
11689;767;Sun;This Pokémon is a coward. As it desperately dashes off, the flailing of its many legs leaves a sparkling clean path in its wake.
11690;767;Moon;Its habitat varies from beaches to seabeds. A natural scavenger, it will gleefully chow down on anything edible, no matter how rotten.
11691;767;Ultra Sun;It will pick up anything it finds on the ground. Sometimes it finds coins, so Murkrow and Meowth will go after it.
11692;767;Ultra Moon;An astonishingly cowardly Pokémon, Wimpod will whir its legs at high speeds to run away if anything comes near it.
11693;767;Sword;It’s nature’s cleaner—it eats anything and everything, including garbage and rotten things. The ground near its nest is always clean.
11694;767;Shield;Wimpod gather in swarms, constantly on the lookout for danger. They scatter the moment they detect an enemy’s presence.
11695;768;Sun;With a flashing slash of its giant sharp claws, it cleaves seawater—or even air—right in two.
11696;768;Moon;It battles skillfully with its six arms, but spends most of its time peacefully meditating in caves deep beneath the sea.
11697;768;Ultra Sun;The shell covering its body is as hard as diamond. This Pokémon will do anything it takes to win.
11698;768;Ultra Moon;Its claws, which it can extend and retract at will, are its greatest weapons. Golisopod is sometimes accompanied by Wimpod.
11699;768;Sword;It will do anything to win, taking advantage of every opening and finishing opponents off with the small claws on its front legs.
11700;768;Shield;They live in sunken ships or in holes in the seabed. When Golisopod and Grapploct battle, the loser becomes the winner’s meal.
11701;769;Sun;Born from a sand mound playfully built by a child, this Pokémon embodies the grudges of the departed.
11702;769;Moon;It takes control of anyone who puts a hand in its mouth. And so it adds to the accumulation of its sand-mound body.
11703;769;Ultra Sun;It likes the shovel on its head, so Sandygast will get serious and fight any children who come to take it back.
11704;769;Ultra Moon;If you build sand mounds when you’re playing, destroy them before you go home, or they may get possessed and become Sandygast.
11705;769;Sword;Grudges of the dead have possessed a mound of sand and become a Pokémon. Sandygast is fond of the shovel on its head.
11706;769;Shield;Sandygast mainly inhabits beaches. It takes control of anyone who puts their hand into its mouth, forcing them to make its body bigger.
11707;770;Sun;Possessed people controlled by this Pokémon transformed its sand mound into a castle. As it evolved, its power to curse grew ever stronger.
11708;770;Moon;Buried beneath the castle are masses of dried-up bones from those whose vitality it has drained.
11709;770;Ultra Sun;Each of its grains of sand has its own will. Palossand eats small Pokémon and siphons away their vital essence while they’re still alive.
11710;770;Ultra Moon;Once it has whipped up a sandstorm to halt its opponents in their tracks, this terrifying Pokémon snatches away their vitality.
11711;770;Sword;Palossand is known as the Beach Nightmare. It pulls its prey down into the sand by controlling the sand itself, and then it sucks out their souls.
11712;770;Shield;This Pokémon lives on beaches, but it hates water. Palossand can’t maintain its castle-like shape if it gets drenched by a heavy rain.
11713;771;Sun;It lives in shallow seas, such as areas near a beach. It can eject its internal organs, which it uses to engulf its prey or battle enemies.
11714;771;Moon;These Pokémon line the beaches. The sticky mucous that covers their bodies can be used to soothe sunburned skin. How convenient!
11715;771;Ultra Sun;The tradition known as Pyukumuku chucking started from the custom of throwing Pyukumuku back into the sea after they wash onshore.
11716;771;Ultra Moon;Its entire body is covered in its own slime. If you accidentally step on one, you’ll slip, and it will get mad and smack you!
11717;771;Sword;It lives in warm, shallow waters. If it encounters a foe, it will spit out its internal organs as a means to punch them.
11718;771;Shield;It’s covered in a slime that keeps its skin moist, allowing it to stay on land for days without drying up.
11719;772;Sun;The heavy control mask it wears suppresses its intrinsic capabilities. This Pokémon has some hidden special power.
11720;772;Moon;Due to the danger that this synthetic Pokémon may go on a rampage, it wears a control mask to restrain its power.
11721;772;Ultra Sun;A Pokémon weapon developed for a specific mission, it went berserk during an experiment, so it was cryogenically frozen.
11722;772;Ultra Moon;There’s danger of its going on a rampage, so its true power is sealed away beneath its control mask.
11723;772;Sword;Rumor has it that the theft of top-secret research notes led to a new instance of this Pokémon being created in the Galar region.
11724;772;Shield;It was modeled after a mighty Pokémon of myth. The mask placed upon it limits its power in order to keep it under control.
11725;773;Sun;Its trust in its partner is what awakens it. This Pokémon is capable of changing its type, a flexibility that is well displayed in battle.
11726;773;Moon;Although its name was Type: Null at first, the boy who evolved it into this form gave it the name by which it is now known.
11727;773;Ultra Sun;This is its form once it has awakened and evolved. Freed from its heavy mask, its speed is greatly increased.
11728;773;Ultra Moon;Through the bond it formed with its Trainer, its will was strengthened, and it was able to destroy its control mask.
11729;773;Sword;A solid bond of trust between this Pokémon and its Trainer awakened the strength hidden within Silvally. It can change its type at will.
11730;773;Shield;The final factor needed to release this Pokémon’s true power was a strong bond with a Trainer it trusts.
11731;774;Sun;Originally making its home in the ozone layer, it hurtles to the ground when the shell enclosing its body grows too heavy.
11732;774;Moon;Strong impacts can knock it out of its shell. This Pokémon was born from mutated nanoparticles.
11733;774;Ultra Sun;It lives in the ozone layer, where it becomes food for stronger Pokémon. When it tries to run away, it falls to the ground.
11734;774;Ultra Moon;Although its outer shell is uncommonly durable, the shock of falling to the ground smashes the shell to smithereens.
11735;774;Sun;Originally making its home in the ozone layer, it hurtles to the ground when the shell enclosing its body grows too heavy.
11736;774;Moon;Strong impacts can knock it out of its shell. This Pokémon was born from mutated nanoparticles.
11737;774;Ultra Sun;It lives in the ozone layer, where it becomes food for stronger Pokémon. When it tries to run away, it falls to the ground.
11738;774;Ultra Moon;Although its outer shell is uncommonly durable, the shock of falling to the ground smashes the shell to smithereens.
11739;775;Sun;It is born asleep, and it dies asleep. All its movements are apparently no more than the results of it tossing and turning in its dreams.
11740;775;Moon;The log it holds was given to it by its parents at birth. It has also been known to cling to the arm of a friendly Trainer.
11741;775;Ultra Sun;It stays asleep from the moment it’s born. When it falls into a deep sleep, it stops moving altogether.
11742;775;Ultra Moon;It remains asleep from birth to death as a result of the sedative properties of the leaves that form its diet.
11743;776;Sun;The shell on its back is chemically unstable and explodes violently if struck. The hole in its stomach is its weak point.
11744;776;Moon;It gushes fire and poisonous gases from its nostrils. Its dung is an explosive substance and can be put to various uses.
11745;776;Ultra Sun;It lives in volcanoes and eats sulfur and other minerals. Materials from the food it eats form the basis of its explosive shell.
11746;776;Ultra Moon;Its exploding shell poses a real danger but is sensitive to moisture. On rainy days, Turtonator takes silent refuge in caves.
11747;776;Sword;Explosive substances coat the shell on its back. Enemies that dare attack it will be blown away by an immense detonation.
11748;776;Shield;Eating sulfur in its volcanic habitat is what causes explosive compounds to develop in its shell. Its droppings are also dangerously explosive.
11749;777;Sun;The spiny fur on its back is normally at rest. When this Pokémon becomes agitated, its fur stands on end and stabs into its attackers.
11750;777;Moon;The long hairs on its back act as lightning rods. The bolts of lightning it attracts are stored as energy in its electric sac.
11751;777;Ultra Sun;When it’s surprised or agitated, the 14 fur spikes on its back will stand up involuntarily.
11752;777;Ultra Moon;Its capacity to produce electricity is somewhat limited, so it gets charged up by letting lightning strike it!
11753;777;Sword;With the long hairs on its back, this Pokémon takes in electricity from other electric Pokémon. It stores what it absorbs in an electric sac.
11754;777;Shield;When it’s in trouble, it curls up into a ball, makes its fur spikes stand on end, and then discharges electricity indiscriminately.
11755;778;Sun;After going to all the effort of disguising itself, its neck was broken. Whatever is inside is probably unharmed, but it’s still feeling sad.
11756;778;Moon;If its neck is broken or its rag torn during an attack, it works through the night to patch it.
11757;778;Ultra Sun;It stands in front of a mirror, trying to fix its broken neck as if its life depended on it. It has a hard time getting it right, so it’s crying inside.
11758;778;Ultra Moon;Sad that its true identity may be exposed, Mimikyu will mercilessly seek revenge on any opponent that breaks its neck.
11759;778;Sword;There will be no forgiveness for any who reveal that it was pretending to be Pikachu. It will bring the culprit down, even at the cost of its own life.
11760;778;Shield;Its disguise made from an old rag allowed it to avoid an attack, but the impact broke the neck of the disguise. Now everyone knows it’s a Mimikyu.
11761;779;Sun;When it unleashes its psychic power from the protuberance on its head, the grating sound of grinding teeth echoes through the area.
11762;779;Moon;It stuns its prey with psychokinesis and then grinds them to mush with its strong teeth. Even Shellder’s shell is no match for it.
11763;779;Ultra Sun;It burrows beneath the sand, radiating psychic power from the protuberance on its head. It waits for prey as it surveys the area.
11764;779;Ultra Moon;Its skin is thick enough to fend off Mareanie’s spikes. With its robust teeth, Bruxish crunches up the spikes and eats them.
11765;780;Sun;It has a compassionate personality, but if it is angered, it completely destroys its surroundings with its intense breath.
11766;780;Moon;This Pokémon is friendly to people and loves children most of all. It comes from deep in the mountains to play with children it likes in town.
11767;780;Ultra Sun;If a child it has made friends with is bullied, Drampa will find the bully’s house and burn it to the ground.
11768;780;Ultra Moon;It appears in towns and plays with the children. Drampa will protect kids when they’re in danger, so their moms don’t have to worry.
11769;780;Sword;The mountains it calls home are nearly two miles in height. On rare occasions, it descends to play with the children living in the towns below.
11770;780;Shield;Drampa is a kind and friendly Pokémon—up until it’s angered. When that happens, it stirs up a gale and flattens everything around.
11771;781;Sun;Swinging its massive anchor, it can KO Wailord in a single blow. What appears to be green seaweed is actually its body.
11772;781;Moon;The soul of seaweed adrift in the waves became reborn as this Pokémon. It maintains itself with new infusions of seabed detritus and seaweed.
11773;781;Ultra Sun;It wraps its prey in green seaweed and sucks away their vitality. It only likes to go after big prey like Wailord.
11774;781;Ultra Moon;Its chain-like green seaweed can stretch outward for hundreds of yards. For some reason, it gets along well with Skrelp.
11775;781;Sword;After a piece of seaweed merged with debris from a sunken ship, it was reborn as this ghost Pokémon.
11776;781;Shield;After lowering its anchor, it waits for its prey. It catches large Wailord and drains their life-force.

11910;808;Sword;It dissolves and eats metal. Circulating liquid metal within its body is how it generates energy.
11911;808;Shield;They live as a group, but when the time comes, one strong Meltan will absorb all the others and evolve.
11912;809;Let's Go Pikachu,Let's Go Eevee;Revered long ago for its capacity to create iron from nothing, for some reason it has come back to life after 3,000 years.
11913;809;Sword;At the end of its life-span, Melmetal will rust and fall apart. The small shards left behind will eventually be reborn as Meltan.
11914;809;Shield;Centrifugal force is behind the punches of Melmetal’s heavy hex-nut arms. Melmetal is said to deliver the strongest punches of all Pokémon.

11919;812;Sword;By drumming, it taps into the power of its special tree stump. The roots of the stump follow its direction in battle.

11927;816;Sword;When scared, this Pokémon cries. Its tears pack the chemical punch of 100 onions, and attackers won’t be able to resist weeping.

11931;818;Sword;It has many hidden capabilities, such as fingertips that can shoot water and a membrane on its back that it can use to glide through the air.
11932;818;Shield;Its nictitating membranes let it pick out foes’ weak points so it can precisely blast them with water that shoots from its fingertips at Mach 3.
11933;819;Sword;Found throughout the Galar region, this Pokémon becomes uneasy if its cheeks are ever completely empty of berries.
11934;819;Shield;It eats berries nonstop—a habit that has made it more resilient than it looks. It’ll show up on farms, searching for yet more berries.
11935;820;Sword;It stashes berries in its tail—so many berries that they fall out constantly. But this Pokémon is a bit slow-witted, so it doesn’t notice the loss.
11936;820;Shield;Common throughout the Galar region, this Pokémon has strong teeth and can chew through the toughest of berry shells.
11937;821;Sword;It will bravely challenge any opponent, no matter how powerful. This Pokémon benefits from every battle—even a defeat increases its strength a bit.

11940;822;Shield;The lessons of many harsh battles have taught it how to accurately judge an opponent’s strength.
11941;823;Sword;This Pokémon reigns supreme in the skies of the Galar region. The black luster of its steel body could drive terror into the heart of any foe.
11942;823;Shield;With their great intellect and flying skills, these Pokémon very successfully act as the Galar region’s airborne taxi service.
11943;824;Sword;A constant collector of information, this Pokémon is very smart. Very strong is what it isn’t.
11944;824;Shield;Often found in gardens, this Pokémon has hairs on its body that it uses to assess its surroundings.
11945;825;Sword;It barely moves, but it’s still alive. Hiding in its shell without food or water seems to have awakened its psychic powers.
11946;825;Shield;As it grows inside its shell, it uses its psychic abilities to monitor the outside world and prepare for evolution.
11947;826;Sword;It’s famous for its high level of intelligence, and the large size of its brain is proof that it also possesses immense psychic power.
11948;826;Shield;It emits psychic energy to observe and study what’s around it—and what’s around it can include things over six miles away.
11949;827;Sword;Aided by the soft pads on its feet, it silently raids the food stores of other Pokémon. It survives off its ill-gotten gains.
11950;827;Shield;Cunning and cautious, this Pokémon survives by stealing food from others. It erases its tracks with swipes of its tail as it makes off with its plunder.
11951;828;Sword;It secretly marks potential targets with a scent. By following the scent, it stalks its targets and steals from them when they least expect it.
11952;828;Shield;With a lithe body and sharp claws, it goes around stealing food and eggs. Boltund is its natural enemy.
11953;829;Sword;It anchors itself in the ground with its single leg, then basks in the sun. After absorbing enough sunlight, its petals spread as it blooms brilliantly.
11954;829;Shield;It whirls around in the wind while singing a joyous song. This delightful display has charmed many into raising this Pokémon.
11955;830;Sword;The seeds attached to its cotton fluff are full of nutrients. It spreads them on the wind so that plants and other Pokémon can benefit from them.
11956;830;Shield;The cotton on the head of this Pokémon can be spun into a glossy, gorgeous yarn—a Galar regional specialty.
11957;831;Sword;Its curly fleece is such an effective cushion that this Pokémon could fall off a cliff and stand right back up at the bottom, unharmed.
11958;831;Shield;If its fleece grows too long, Wooloo won’t be able to move. Cloth made with the wool of this Pokémon is surprisingly strong.
11959;832;Sword;Weave a carpet from its springy wool, and you end up with something closer to a trampoline. You’ll start to bounce the moment you set foot on it.
11960;832;Shield;Its majestic horns are meant only to impress the opposite gender. They never see use in battle.
11961;833;Sword;Apparently the itch of its teething impels it to snap its jaws at anything in front of it.
11962;833;Shield;It starts off battles by attacking with its rock-hard horn, but as soon as the opponent flinches, this Pokémon bites down and never lets go.
11963;834;Sword;With jaws that can shear through steel rods, this highly aggressive Pokémon chomps down on its unfortunate prey.
11964;834;Shield;This Pokémon rapidly extends its retractable neck to sink its sharp fangs into distant enemies and take them down.

11966;835;Shield;This gluttonous Pokémon only assists people with their work because it wants treats. As it runs, it crackles with electricity.
11967;836;Sword;This Pokémon generates electricity and channels it into its legs to keep them going strong. Boltund can run nonstop for three full days.
11968;836;Shield;It sends electricity through its legs to boost their strength. Running at top speed, it easily breaks 50 mph.
11969;837;Sword;Most of its body has the same composition as coal. Fittingly, this Pokémon was first discovered in coal mines about 400 years ago.
11970;837;Shield;It can race around like a unicycle, even on rough, rocky terrain. Burning coal sustains it.
11971;838;Sword;It forms coal inside its body. Coal dropped by this Pokémon once helped fuel the lives of people in the Galar region.
11972;838;Shield;By rapidly rolling its legs, it can travel at over 18 mph. The temperature of the flames it breathes exceeds 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit.
11973;839;Sword;It’s usually peaceful, but the vandalism of mines enrages it. Offenders will be incinerated with flames that reach 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit.
11974;839;Shield;While it’s engaged in battle, its mountain of coal will burn bright red, sending off sparks that scorch the surrounding area.
11975;840;Sword;It spends its entire life inside an apple. It hides from its natural enemies, bird Pokémon, by pretending it’s just an apple and nothing more.
11976;840;Shield;As soon as it’s born, it burrows into an apple. Not only does the apple serve as its food source, but the flavor of the fruit determines its evolution.
11977;841;Sword;It ate a sour apple, and that induced its evolution. In its cheeks, it stores an acid capable of causing chemical burns.
11978;841;Shield;It flies on wings of apple skin and spits a powerful acid. It can also change its shape into that of an apple.
11979;842;Sword;Eating a sweet apple caused its evolution. A nectarous scent wafts from its body, luring in the bug Pokémon it preys on.
11980;842;Shield;Its body is covered in sweet nectar, and the skin on its back is especially yummy. Children used to have it as a snack.
11981;843;Sword;As it digs, it swallows sand and stores it in its neck pouch. The pouch can hold more than 17 pounds of sand.
11982;843;Shield;It spews sand from its nostrils. While the enemy is blinded, it burrows into the ground to hide.
11983;844;Sword;When it contracts its body, over 220 pounds of sand sprays from its nose. If it ever runs out of sand, it becomes disheartened.
11984;844;Shield;Its unique style of coiling allows it to blast sand out of its sand sac more efficiently.
11985;845;Sword;It’s so strong that it can knock out some opponents in a single hit, but it also may forget what it’s battling midfight.
11986;845;Shield;This hungry Pokémon swallows Arrokuda whole. Occasionally, it makes a mistake and tries to swallow a Pokémon other than its preferred prey.
11987;846;Sword;If it sees any movement around it, this Pokémon charges for it straightaway, leading with its sharply pointed jaw. It’s very proud of that jaw.
11988;846;Shield;After it’s eaten its fill, its movements become extremely sluggish. That’s when Cramorant swallows it up.
11989;847;Sword;This Pokémon has a jaw that’s as sharp as a spear and as strong as steel. Apparently Barraskewda’s flesh is surprisingly tasty, too.
11990;847;Shield;It spins its tail fins to propel itself, surging forward at speeds of over 100 knots before ramming prey and spearing into them.
11991;848;Sword;It stores poison in an internal poison sac and secretes that poison through its skin. If you touch this Pokémon, a tingling sensation follows.
11992;848;Shield;It manipulates the chemical makeup of its poison to produce electricity. The voltage is weak, but it can cause a tingling paralysis.
11993;849;Sword;Capable of generating 15,000 volts of electricity, this Pokémon looks down on all that would challenge it.
11994;849;Shield;It has an electrical organ on its chest. While generating electricity, it fills its surroundings with what sounds like the strumming of a bass guitar.
11995;849;Sword;Capable of generating 15,000 volts of electricity, this Pokémon looks down on all that would challenge it.
11996;849;Shield;It has an electrical organ on its chest. While generating electricity, it fills its surroundings with what sounds like the strumming of a bass guitar.
11997;850;Sword;It stores flammable gas in its body and uses it to generate heat. The yellow sections on its belly get particularly hot.
11998;850;Shield;It wraps prey up with its heated body, cooking them in its coils. Once they’re well-done, it will voraciously nibble them down to the last morsel.
11999;851;Sword;When it heats up, its body temperature reaches about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. It lashes its body like a whip and launches itself at enemies.
12000;851;Shield;While its burning body is already dangerous on its own, this excessively hostile Pokémon also has large and very sharp fangs.
12001;852;Sword;It’s very curious, but its means of investigating things is to try to punch them with its tentacles. The search for food is what brings it onto land.
12002;852;Shield;Its tentacles tear off easily, but it isn’t alarmed when that happens—it knows they’ll grow back. It’s about as smart as a three-year-old.
12003;853;Sword;A body made up of nothing but muscle makes the grappling moves this Pokémon performs with its tentacles tremendously powerful.
12004;853;Shield;Searching for an opponent to test its skills against, it emerges onto land. Once the battle is over, it returns to the sea.
12005;854;Sword;The swirl pattern in this Pokémon’s body is its weakness. If it gets stirred, the swirl loses its shape, and Sinistea gets dizzy.
12006;854;Shield;It absorbs the life-force of those who drink it. It waits patiently, but opportunities are fleeting— it tastes so bad that it gets spat out immediately.
12007;855;Sword;Trainers Polteageist trusts will be allowed to experience its distinctive flavor and aroma firsthand by sampling just a tiny bit of its tea.
12008;855;Shield;When angered, it launches tea from its body at the offender’s mouth. The tea causes strong chills if swallowed.
12009;856;Sword;Via the protrusion on its head, it senses other creatures’ emotions. If you don’t have a calm disposition, it will never warm up to you.
12010;856;Shield;If this Pokémon senses a strong emotion, it will run away as fast as it can. It prefers areas without people.
12011;857;Sword;No matter who you are, if you bring strong emotions near this Pokémon, it will silence you violently.
12012;857;Shield;Using the braids on its head, it pummels foes to get them to quiet down. One blow from those braids would knock out a professional boxer.
12013;858;Sword;It emits psychic power strong enough to cause headaches as a deterrent to the approach of others.
12014;858;Shield;If you’re too loud around it, you risk being torn apart by the claws on its tentacle. This Pokémon is also known as the Forest Witch.
12015;859;Sword;Through its nose, it sucks in the emanations produced by people and Pokémon when they feel annoyed. It thrives off this negative energy.
12016;859;Shield;It sneaks into people’s homes, stealing things and feasting on the negative energy of the frustrated occupants.
12017;860;Sword;When it gets down on all fours as if to beg for forgiveness, it’s trying to lure opponents in so that it can stab them with its spear-like hair.
12018;860;Shield;With sly cunning, it tries to lure people into the woods. Some believe it to have the power to make crops grow.
12019;861;Sword;With the hair wrapped around its body helping to enhance its muscles, this Pokémon can overwhelm even Machamp.
12020;861;Shield;Its hairs work like muscle fibers. When its hairs unfurl, they latch on to opponents, ensnaring them as tentacles would.
12021;862;Sword;Its voice is staggering in volume. Obstagoon has a tendency to take on a threatening posture and shout—this move is known as Obstruct.
12022;862;Shield;It evolved after experiencing numerous fights. While crossing its arms, it lets out a shout that would make any opponent flinch.
12023;863;Sword;What appears to be an iron helmet is actually hardened hair. This Pokémon lives for the thrill of battle.
12024;863;Shield;After many battles, it evolved dangerous claws that come together to form daggers when extended.
12025;864;Sword;Its shell is overflowing with its heightened otherworldly energy. The ectoplasm serves as protection for this Pokémon’s core spirit.
12026;864;Shield;Be cautious of the ectoplasmic body surrounding its soul. You’ll become stiff as stone if you touch it.
12027;865;Sword;Only Farfetch’d that have survived many battles can attain this evolution. When this Pokémon’s leek withers, it will retire from combat.
12028;865;Shield;After deflecting attacks with its hard leaf shield, it strikes back with its sharp leek stalk. The leek stalk is both weapon and food.
12029;866;Sword;It’s highly skilled at tap-dancing. It waves its cane of ice in time with its graceful movements.
12030;866;Shield;Its amusing movements make it very popular. It releases its psychic power from the pattern on its belly.
12031;867;Sword;A powerful curse was woven into an ancient painting. After absorbing the spirit of a Yamask, the painting began to move.
12032;867;Shield;Never touch its shadowlike body, or you’ll be shown the horrific memories behind the picture carved into it.
12033;868;Sword;This Pokémon was born from sweet-smelling particles in the air. Its body is made of cream.
12034;868;Shield;They say that any patisserie visited by Milcery is guaranteed success and good fortune.
12035;869;Sword;The moment it evolved, it took on a bitter flavor. This is because of the way its cells spontaneously shifted during evolution.
12036;869;Shield;The cells that compose its cream fluctuated suddenly during evolution, giving the cream a bitter flavor.
12037;870;Sword;Five of them are troopers, and one is the brass. The brass’s orders are absolute.
12038;870;Shield;The six of them work together as one Pokémon. Teamwork is also their battle strategy, and they constantly change their formation as they fight.
12039;871;Sword;It feeds on seaweed, using its teeth to scrape it off rocks. Electric current flows from the tips of its spines.
12040;871;Shield;It stores electricity in each spine. Even if one gets broken off, it still continues to emit electricity for at least three hours.
12041;872;Sword;It spits out thread imbued with a frigid sort of energy and uses it to tie its body to branches, disguising itself as an icicle while it sleeps.
12042;872;Shield;It eats snow that piles up on the ground. The more snow it eats, the bigger and more impressive the spikes on its back grow.
12043;873;Sword;Icy scales fall from its wings like snow as it flies over fields and mountains. The temperature of its wings is less than −290 degrees Fahrenheit.
12044;873;Shield;It shows no mercy to any who desecrate fields and mountains. It will fly around on its icy wings, causing a blizzard to chase offenders away.
12045;874;Sword;It stands in grasslands, watching the sun’s descent from zenith to horizon. This Pokémon has a talent for delivering dynamic kicks.
12046;874;Shield;Once a year, on a specific date and at a specific time, they gather out of nowhere and form up in a circle.
12047;875;Sword;It drifted in on the flow of ocean waters from a frigid place. It keeps its head iced constantly to make sure it stays nice and cold.
12048;875;Shield;This Pokémon keeps its heat-sensitive head cool with ice. It fishes for its food, dangling its single hair into the sea to lure in prey.
12049;875;Sword;It drifted in on the flow of ocean waters from a frigid place. It keeps its head iced constantly to make sure it stays nice and cold.
12050;875;Shield;This Pokémon keeps its heat-sensitive head cool with ice. It fishes for its food, dangling its single hair into the sea to lure in prey.
12051;876;Sword;It uses the horns on its head to sense the emotions of others. Males will act as valets for those they serve, looking after their every need.
12052;876;Shield;Through its horns, it can pick up on the emotions of creatures around it. Positive emotions are the source of its strength.
12053;876;Sword;It uses the horns on its head to sense the emotions of others. Males will act as valets for those they serve, looking after their every need.
12054;876;Shield;Through its horns, it can pick up on the emotions of creatures around it. Positive emotions are the source of its strength.
12055;877;Sword;As it eats the seeds stored up in its pocket-like pouches, this Pokémon is not just satisfying its constant hunger. It’s also generating electricity.
12056;877;Shield;It carries electrically roasted seeds with it as if they’re precious treasures. No matter how much it eats, it always gets hungry again in short order.
12057;877;Sword;As it eats the seeds stored up in its pocket-like pouches, this Pokémon is not just satisfying its constant hunger. It’s also generating electricity.
12058;877;Shield;It carries electrically roasted seeds with it as if they’re precious treasures. No matter how much it eats, it always gets hungry again in short order.
12059;878;Sword;It digs up the ground with its trunk. It’s also very strong, being able to carry loads of over five tons without any problem at all.
12060;878;Shield;If a job requires serious strength, this Pokémon will excel at it. Its copper body tarnishes in the rain, turning a vibrant green color.
12061;879;Sword;They came over from another region long ago and worked together with humans. Their green skin is resistant to water.
12062;879;Shield;These Pokémon live in herds. Their trunks have incredible grip strength, strong enough to crush giant rocks into powder.
12063;880;Sword;In ancient times, it was unbeatable thanks to its powerful lower body, but it went extinct anyway after it depleted all its plant-based food sources.
12064;880;Shield;The powerful muscles in its tail generate its electricity. Compared to its lower body, its upper half is entirely too small.
12065;881;Sword;The shaking of its freezing upper half is what generates its electricity. It has a hard time walking around.
12066;881;Shield;This Pokémon lived on prehistoric seashores and was able to preserve food with the ice on its body. It went extinct because it moved so slowly.
12067;882;Sword;Powerful legs and jaws made it the apex predator of its time. Its own overhunting of its prey was what drove it to extinction.
12068;882;Shield;Its mighty legs are capable of running at speeds exceeding 40 mph, but this Pokémon can’t breathe unless it’s underwater.
12069;883;Sword;Though it’s able to capture prey by freezing its surroundings, it has trouble eating the prey afterward because its mouth is on top of its head.
12070;883;Shield;The skin on its face is impervious to attack, but breathing difficulties made this Pokémon go extinct anyway.
12071;884;Sword;Its body resembles polished metal, and it’s both lightweight and strong. The only drawback is that it rusts easily.
12072;884;Shield;The special metal that composes its body is very light, so this Pokémon has considerable agility. It lives in caves because it dislikes the rain.
12073;885;Sword;After being reborn as a ghost Pokémon, Dreepy wanders the areas it used to inhabit back when it was alive in prehistoric seas.
12074;885;Shield;If this weak Pokémon is by itself, a mere child could defeat it. But if Dreepy has friends to help it train, it can evolve and become much stronger.
12075;886;Sword;It’s capable of flying faster than 120 mph. It battles alongside Dreepy and dotes on them until they successfully evolve.
12076;886;Shield;Without a Dreepy to place on its head and care for, it gets so uneasy it’ll try to substitute any Pokémon it finds for the missing Dreepy.
12077;887;Sword;When it isn’t battling, it keeps Dreepy in the holes on its horns. Once a fight starts, it launches the Dreepy like supersonic missiles.
12078;887;Shield;Apparently the Dreepy inside Dragapult’s horns eagerly look forward to being launched out at Mach speeds.
12079;888;Sword;Now armed with a weapon it used in ancient times, this Pokémon needs only a single strike to fell even Gigantamax Pokémon.
12080;888;Shield;Able to cut down anything with a single strike, it became known as the Fairy King’s Sword, and it inspired awe in friend and foe alike.
12081;888;Sword;Now armed with a weapon it used in ancient times, this Pokémon needs only a single strike to fell even Gigantamax Pokémon.
12082;888;Shield;Able to cut down anything with a single strike, it became known as the Fairy King’s Sword, and it inspired awe in friend and foe alike.
12083;889;Sword;Its ability to deflect any attack led to it being known as the Fighting Master’s Shield. It was feared and respected by all.
12084;889;Shield;Now that it’s equipped with its shield, it can shrug off impressive blows, including the attacks of Dynamax Pokémon.
12085;889;Sword;Its ability to deflect any attack led to it being known as the Fighting Master’s Shield. It was feared and respected by all.
12086;889;Shield;Now that it’s equipped with its shield, it can shrug off impressive blows, including the attacks of Dynamax Pokémon.
12087;890;Sword;The core on its chest absorbs energy emanating from the lands of the Galar region. This energy is what allows Eternatus to stay active.
12088;890;Shield;It was inside a meteorite that fell 20,000 years ago. There seems to be a connection between this Pokémon and the Dynamax phenomenon.
12089;890;Sword;The core on its chest absorbs energy emanating from the lands of the Galar region. This energy is what allows Eternatus to stay active.
12090;890;Shield;It was inside a meteorite that fell 20,000 years ago. There seems to be a connection between this Pokémon and the Dynamax phenomenon.
12091;891;Sword;Kubfu trains hard to perfect its moves. The moves it masters will determine which form it takes when it evolves.
12092;891;Shield;If Kubfu pulls the long white hair on its head, its fighting spirit heightens and power wells up from the depths of its belly.
12093;892;Sword;People call it the embodiment of rage. It’s said that this Pokémon’s terrifying expression and shout will rid the world of malevolence.
12094;892;Shield;The energy released by this Pokémon’s fists forms shock waves that can blow away Dynamax Pokémon in just one hit.
12095;892;Sword;People call it the embodiment of rage. It’s said that this Pokémon’s terrifying expression and shout will rid the world of malevolence.
12096;892;Shield;The energy released by this Pokémon’s fists forms shock waves that can blow away Dynamax Pokémon in just one hit.
12097;893;Sword;Within dense forests, this Pokémon lives in a pack with others of its kind. It’s incredibly aggressive, and the other Pokémon of the forest fear it.
12098;893;Shield;Once the vines on Zarude’s body tear off, they become nutrients in the soil. This helps the plants of the forest grow.
12099;894;Sword;This Pokémon is a cluster of electrical energy. It’s said that removing the rings on Regieleki’s body will unleash the Pokémon’s latent power.
12100;894;Shield;Its entire body is made up of a single organ that generates electrical energy. Regieleki is capable of creating all Galar’s electricity.
12101;895;Sword;An academic theory proposes that Regidrago’s arms were once the head of an ancient dragon Pokémon. The theory remains unproven.
12102;895;Shield;Its body is composed of crystallized dragon energy. Regidrago is said to have the powers of every dragon Pokémon.
12103;896;Sword;Glastrier emits intense cold from its hooves. It’s also a belligerent Pokémon—anything it wants, it takes by force.
12104;896;Shield;Glastrier has tremendous physical strength, and the mask of ice covering its face is 100 times harder than diamond.
12105;897;Sword;It probes its surroundings with all its senses save one—it doesn’t use its sense of sight. Spectrier’s kicks are said to separate soul from body.
12106;897;Shield;As it dashes through the night, Spectrier absorbs the life-force of sleeping creatures. It craves silence and solitude.
12107;898;Sword;Calyrex is a merciful Pokémon, capable of providing healing and blessings. It reigned over the Galar region in times of yore.
12108;898;Shield;Calyrex is known in legend as a king that ruled over Galar in ancient times. It has the power to cause hearts to mend and plants to spring forth.
12109;898;Sword;Calyrex is a merciful Pokémon, capable of providing healing and blessings. It reigned over the Galar region in times of yore.
12110;898;Shield;Calyrex is known in legend as a king that ruled over Galar in ancient times. It has the power to cause hearts to mend and plants to spring forth.
12111;898;Sword;Calyrex is a merciful Pokémon, capable of providing healing and blessings. It reigned over the Galar region in times of yore.
12112;898;Shield;Calyrex is known in legend as a king that ruled over Galar in ancient times. It has the power to cause hearts to mend and plants to spring forth.
